3.5.2 Using the Options key and more...</A>
</H3>

<P>
The keyboard has always been the essential user interface to Emacs -
it's what makes Emacs so efficient as an editor for daily
tasks. There are keyboard bindings for pretty much every task. Many
bindings involve pressing the ``Meta'' modifier key - it's a key just
like Control or Shift, which all go together with another (normal)
key. ``Meta'' has only really existed on Unix keyboards long time ago
-- nowadays, computers have other keys instead. Therefore, you will
need to press another key on your Macintosh keyboard. <I>By default, this
is the Option key</I>, but you can use the ESC key instead (in this case,
you may press ESC first, then the rest of the keys).
