14.4 Changes--- 3.0</A>
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This Aquamacs is based on Emacs 24. Highlights:

 
<UL>
<LI>A major addition to Emacs 24 is its package managing system.  (Start with M-x list-packages.  Re-installing included packages is not recommended.)
</LI>
<LI>There is a new word count function (see Aquamacs Edit menu).
</LI>
<LI>Right-to-left text (Arabic, Persian, Hebrew) is well supported now even when mixed with left-to-right text.
</LI>
<LI>Completion has been improved (e.g., it is connected to the CEDET Semantic library.  When enabled, you can use M-Tab to complete symbols in C mode, for instance.)
</LI>
<LI>Please refer to <TT><A NAME="tex2html35"
  HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/</A></TT> for a list of changes in GNU Emacs 24.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs 3.x is distributed as a binary for 64-bit Intel Macs only.  If you would like to run Aquamacs on a 32-bit Mac, or a PowerPC based Mac, you may still build it yourself from source, or use Aquamacs 2.5.
</LI>
<LI>High-resolution retina screens are better supported by the `preview' function in LaTeX mode.  Previews are rendered in a size adjusted to the font used to edit the document.
</LI>
<LI>New, high-resolution icons appear in the toolbar (for LaTeX); standard visual effects and animations are used for new frames.
</LI>
<LI>`mouse-drag-copy-region' is enabled (non-nil), which maintain behavior similar to that of the previous Aquamacs and Emacs versions.  Selecting some text with the mouse will add it to the kill-ring, so that users may insert it with C-y.
</LI>
<LI>The region is no longer extended when dragging the mouse while holding the Shift key, because the `mouse-sel' package is now obsolete in Emacs 24.  Users can, for the time being, bring back the functionality by adding the following to their <#911#><TT>Preferences.el</TT><#911#> file:
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim30#</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Smart spacing no longer affects text yanked with mouse-2 (Command-mouse click), for the the time being.  To get this added convenience, <#914#><TT>(global-set-key (vector `(mouse-2)) 'mouse-yank-at-click)</TT><#914#> may be used.
These hints suggested by Konrad Podczeck.
</LI>
<LI>Abbreviations are, by default, persistant: they are saved upon quitting Aquamacs.  Configure `save-abbrevs' to change this default.
</LI>
<LI><#915#><B>paredit-mode</B><#915#> is included (version 23), which provides operations that, in Lisp, preserve the integrity of the syntax trees (i.e., keep/delete s-expressions as a whole).  See here for more information: <TT><A NAME="tex2html36"

<LI><#918#><B>dart-mode</B><#918#> (version 0.9) included.  Written by Nathan Weizenbaum. File endings: <#919#><TT>.dart</TT><#919#>.
</LI>

</LI>
<LI><#922#><B>python-mode</B><#922#> updated to version 6.1.3 (pre-release 2014-01-19).  Comes with a streamlined menu and many detailed improvements, but drops Pymacs integration.  Aquamacs will bring back Ropemacs and Pymacs in a future version.  See here for changes: <TT><A NAME="tex2html38"
