3.3 File</A>
</H2>
The File menu includes basic operations for opening, closing, and printing files. Opening and saving files uses standard Mac keyboard shortcuts (Command-O, Command-S), and uses standard Aqua dialog boxes.

<P>
You can create a new buffer: Aquamacs allows you to choose from a list of recently and commonly used editing modes.  A similar function lets you change the current editing mode.

<P>
You can also open a directory. When called by mouse from the menubar, this brings up a standard Aqua dialog box. When called up with a keyboard command (C-x d), it brings up a directory name in the ``minibuffer'' (small space for commands at the bottom of the main window, or frame).

<P>
Printing is fully supported, although no ``Page Setup'' option is available at this point.  You will see a print screen (in the system's Preview.app) from where you can select a printer and the usual options.  This may take a few seconds to appear with very large buffers. (Printing of embedded images such in LaTeX Preview mode is currently not supported.)

<P>
You may export your buffer to PDF or to HTML format. This operation
preserves all the formatting, including any word-wrapping - so you may
want to choose a font and resize the frame so that the lines are
wrapped in the intended way (if Soft Wrapping is used).

<P>
The paper size for printing and PDF export can be configured by customizing the variable `ps-paper-type' (use Options / Customize Aquamacs / Specific Option).

<P>
