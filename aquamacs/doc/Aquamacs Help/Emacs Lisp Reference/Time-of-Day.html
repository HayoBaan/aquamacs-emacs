<h3 class="section">38.5 Time of Day</h3>

<p><a name="index-time-of-day-4626"></a>
  This section explains how to determine the current time and time
zone.

   <p><a name="index-epoch-4627"></a>  Most of these functions represent time as a list of four integers
<code>(</code><var>sec-high</var> <var>sec-low</var> <var>microsec</var> <var>picosec</var><code>)</code>. 
This represents the number of seconds from the <dfn>epoch</dfn> (January
1, 1970 at 00:00 UTC), using the formula:
<var>high</var> * 2**16 + <var>low</var> + <var>micro</var> * 10**&minus;6 +
<var>pico</var> * 10**&minus;12. 
The return value of <code>current-time</code> represents time using this
form, as do the timestamps in the return values of other functions
such as <code>file-attributes</code> (see <a href="Definition-of-file_002dattributes.html#Definition-of-file_002dattributes">Definition of file-attributes</a>).  In some cases, functions may return two- or
three-element lists, with omitted <var>microsec</var> and <var>picosec</var>
components defaulting to zero.

   <p><a name="index-time-value-4628"></a>  Function arguments, e.g., the <var>time</var> argument to
<code>current-time-string</code>, accept a more-general <dfn>time value</dfn>
format, which can be a list of integers as above, or a single number
for seconds since the epoch, or <code>nil</code> for the current time.  You
can convert a time value into a human-readable string using
<code>current-time-string</code> and <code>format-time-string</code>, into a list
of integers using <code>seconds-to-time</code>, and into other forms using
<code>decode-time</code> and <code>float-time</code>.  These functions are
described in the following sections.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-time-string</b><var> &amp;optional time zone<a name="index-current_002dtime_002dstring-4629"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current time and date as a human-readable
string.  The format does not vary for the initial part of the string,
which contains the day of week, month, day of month, and time of day
in that order: the number of characters used for these fields is
always the same, so you can reliably
use <code>substring</code> to extract them.  You should count
characters from the beginning of the string rather than from the end,
as the year might not have exactly four digits, and additional
information may some day be added at the end.

        <p>The argument <var>time</var>, if given, specifies a time to format,
instead of the current time.  The optional argument <var>zone</var>
defaults to the current time zone rule.

     <pre class="example">          (current-time-string)
               &rArr; "Wed Oct 14 22:21:05 1987"
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-time</b><var><a name="index-current_002dtime-4630"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current time, represented as a list of four
integers <code>(</code><var>sec-high</var> <var>sec-low</var> <var>microsec</var> <var>picosec</var><code>)</code>. 
These integers have trailing zeros on systems that return time with
lower resolutions.  On all current machines <var>picosec</var> is a
multiple of 1000, but this may change as higher-resolution clocks
become available. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>float-time</b><var> &amp;optional time<a name="index-float_002dtime-4631"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current time as a floating-point number of
seconds since the epoch.  The optional argument <var>time</var>, if
given, specifies a time to convert instead of the current time.

        <p><em>Warning</em>: Since the result is floating point, it may not be
exact.  Do not use this function if precise time stamps are required.

        <p><code>time-to-seconds</code> is an alias for this function. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>seconds-to-time</b><var> time<a name="index-seconds_002dto_002dtime-4632"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function converts a time value to list-of-integer form. 
For example, if <var>time</var> is a number, <code>(time-to-seconds
(seconds-to-time </code><var>time</var><code>))</code> equals the number unless overflow
or rounding errors occur. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-time-zone</b><var> &amp;optional time zone<a name="index-current_002dtime_002dzone-4633"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-time-zone_002c-current-4634"></a>This function returns a list describing the time zone that the user is
in.

        <p>The value has the form <code>(</code><var>offset</var> <var>name</var><code>)</code>.  Here
<var>offset</var> is an integer giving the number of seconds ahead of UTC
(east of Greenwich).  A negative value means west of Greenwich.  The
second element, <var>name</var>, is a string giving the name of the time
zone.  Both elements change when daylight saving time begins or ends;
if the user has specified a time zone that does not use a seasonal time
adjustment, then the value is constant through time.

        <p>If the operating system doesn't supply all the information necessary to
compute the value, the unknown elements of the list are <code>nil</code>.

        <p>The argument <var>time</var>, if given, specifies a time value to
analyze instead of the current time.  The optional argument <var>zone</var>
defaults to the current time zone rule. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-TZ_002c-environment-variable-4635"></a>The default time zone is determined by the <samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp> environment
variable.  See <a href="System-Environment.html#System-Environment">System Environment</a>.  For example, you can tell Emacs
to default to universal time with <code>(setenv "TZ" "UTC0")</code>.  If
<samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp> is not in the environment, Emacs uses system wall clock time,
which is a platform-dependent default time zone.

   <p><a name="index-time-zone-rule-4636"></a>Functions that convert to and from local time accept an optional
<dfn>time zone rule</dfn> argument, which specifies the conversion's time
zone and daylight saving time history.  If the time zone rule is
omitted or <code>nil</code>, the conversion uses Emacs's default time zone. 
If it is <code>t</code>, the conversion uses Universal Time.  If it is
<code>wall</code>, the conversion uses the system wall clock time.  If it is
a string, the conversion uses the time zone rule equivalent to setting
<samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp> to that string.
