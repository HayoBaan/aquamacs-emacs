Who's behind Aquamacs?

<P>
It's a free software project, and naturally, Aquamacs could not exist
without the help of developers, designers, writers and users. The
following people have contributed code, bug reports and ideas to the
Aquamacs project at one point of the other.<A NAME="tex2html25"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot258"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
<P>
Part of the development team of Aquamacs 3.0 are:  David Reitter (co-founder, lead developer).  Many contributions in bug reports and fixes came from Konrad Podczeck, Nathaniel Cunningham, and other regular users. 

<P>
Kevin Walzer (co-founder) wrote the first manual. Aquamacs contains icon artwork by Adrian Chromenko, Jessica Walker (Aquamacs 2.0/3.0 application icon) and David Reitter,
Jasper Hauser, and the Nuovext Project.  The Aquamacs website was designed by Ted Roden.

<P>
We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of the many authors 
whose source code and hints on public forums have already been
integrated into the build.  They are too numerous to mention here.

<P>
Aquamacs is based on GNU Emacs, which is the work of Richard Stallman
and many other developers, in particular Andrew Choi (original GNU
Emacs-to-MacOS and OSX ports), Steven Tamm, Mitsuharu Yamamoto, Adrian Robert.  Aquamacs also could not exist without the latest code contribtions to GNU Emacs (now lead by Stefan Monnier) and to its Mac/OSX/Nextstep ports ( Jan dj&#228;rv, Yamamoto Mitsuharu, and others). We also would like to acknowledge the work of the many authors of the major modes included.

<P>
Last but not least, Aquamacs exists because of the dedication of
its users, who donate money, report bugs and help us fix them.

<P>
