14.20 Changes---1.1</A>
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Based on GNU Emacs 22.1.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs is now much faster when opening new frames (windows).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Aquamacs binary now starts fine from the command-line on certain Intel machines.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Preference file loading has been revised.  Aquamacs now
  displays helpful error messages if one of the Preferences files
  causes problems. M-x aquamacs-load-preferences allows users to test
  their preference files. Starting from a Terminal window by calling
  the ``Aquamacs Emacs'' binary with a ``-q'' argument will prevent
  Aquamacs from loading any preference files, not just .emacs.
(Note that customizations.el is not meant to be edited by users.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs now starts up faster.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs does not define a number of fontsets any longer on
  startup. Since the font selection dialog can be used (Apple-T),
  fonts can be chosen freely and fontsets only need to be defined to
  combine fonts, which is rarely needed. Users may define their
  fontsets as before - Aquamacs just doesn't do it for them (unless
  such fontsets are used in customizations).
  Call (aquamacs-create-standard-fontsets) from Preferences.el should
  any problem occur.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Emacs 22 Manuals (man / info, available from the Help menu)  are
  now displayed on all systems.
  Reported by Eric Martin.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Customization groups are not shown in separate windows any longer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Plugins may now contain `info' files, which will automatically
  be found by Aquamacs (and M-x info).
Reported by Wei Tang.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>An issue with the font size on some pages of the Aquamacs manual
  (as available from the Help menu) has been addressed.
Reported by David Romano.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The ``Emulate Some Italian Option key combinations'' mode   (emulate-mac-italian-keyboard-mode) allows users to type ``m'' again.   Reported by Domenico Prattichizzo.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>X Resources specified via the OS X defaults system (plist) are
  not supported any longer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Thank you to all users who have donated
        (<TT><A NAME="tex2html51"
  HREF="http://aquamacs.org/donate">http://aquamacs.org/donate</A></TT>). Those who haven't had the
        chance to support the Aquamacs project, please consider a
        contribution now!
