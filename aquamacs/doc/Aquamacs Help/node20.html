3.8 Help</A>
</H2>
The Help menu contains a wealth of information about Aquamacs Emacs and GNU Emacs. Except for the help provided in this document, Aquamacs' Help menu also provides documentation of the Mac-specific customizations with the present User Manual. The general Emacs user help is comprehensive and detailed to the point of possibly overwhelming the inexperienced user. The beginner should definitely start with the Emacs tutorial contained in the Help menu. While geared toward the traditional Emacs interface instead of the OS X Aquamacs version, the tutorial is a good introduction to Emacs' unique capabilities. And, as you gain more experience, you will appreciate the depth of the Emacs documentation.
