</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Initial-frame-alist is respected. (Reported by Alastair Rankine)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When saving a buffer and the Finder is not running, 
	the Finder is not opened any more. (Reported by George W. Gilchrist.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Using dead-keys (like Option-u or Option-n on most
	keyboards) works again. (Reported by Howard Melman and Pierre Albarede
</LI>
<LI>When modified files existed, but no frame was visible and
    one tried to quit Aquamacs, the application seemed to hang while
    prompting for keyboard input (Save file? y/n) in an invisible
    window. This has been fixed. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If no frame is visible and you input text, the frame is  made
    visible so you can see what you are doing.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Closing windows consistently with the mouse now works properly. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Clicking on links to source files in help buffers properly
    opens a new frame (if ``open buffers in separate frames'' is on).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When the buffer shown in a frame changes, sometimes the
    color theme and font were not set correctly; this has been addressed. This could happen when
    ``Show Buffers in Separate Frames'' was off, and one killed a
    buffer. (Reported by Peter Dyballa.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When ``Show Buffers in Separate Frames'' was off, and one killed a
    buffer (kill-buffer, C-x k), the frame was deleted.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>You have the option to save newly created buffers (Command-N)
    that have not been saved yet when you quit Aquamacs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Less frame-dancing (resizing) on startup.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>AUCT<SMALL>E</SMALL>X uses the standard commands again. The menu is
  unstructured for this reason. (Reported by Robert Sloan.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>No frames could be opened when using a two-screen setup
    with the menu bar on the right screen, and a currently selected
    frame on the left screen. This has been addressed.  (Reported by George W. Gilchrist.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Customizing a style for a special display frame (e.g.  help or
    customization) works now.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Recent Files/Clear Menu works again.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Paths and other environment variables are now derived
    from the shell  when
    you start Aquamacs. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Your settings for highlight parens,``Blinking Cursor,'' etc.  are now
    persistent. The function Options/Save Options
    (menu-bar-option-save) now correctly saves such settings. This
    should include most customization settings except some that
    Aquamacs relies on for proper clipboard copy/paste functionality.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The font menu (Options) no longer includes non-existent fonts. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Option/Show-Hide/Menu Bar is gone because you cannot turn off  the
    menu bar on OS X.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>``Send Emacs Bug Report'' now uses the OS X
    default mail program to compose
    a message. This ensures that bug reports actually go through.
    Before, they did not, unless you were running a local SMTP server
    (sendmail/postfix), which is not enabled by default.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed loading of files when file names contain certain  Kanji characters,
    due to a bug in AppleScript.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The menu shortcut entries were corrected.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Characters that require the use of the option key work again. For
    example, Alt-3 produces the pound sign (&#163;<#3059#><#3059#>) on a US keyboard,
    Alt-L the `at' sign @ and Alt-Shift-7 the backslash <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1213# on a
    German one. Inputting the Euro sign works, too. <I>However, that means that the option key is not used to emulate
    the `meta' modifier;  you will have to use Esc to do that.</I>
    Alternatively, you can map the option key to meta in your .emacs
    file:

<P>
<TT>    (setq mac-option-modifier 'meta)</TT>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Improvements in the fontset selection allow you to display the  Euro sign
    with the default font.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We have moved Aquamacs to <TT><A NAME="tex2html54"
  HREF="http://aquamacs.org">http://aquamacs.org</A></TT>.

<P>
The Aquamacs wiki is now at <TT><A NAME="tex2html55"
  HREF="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/AquamacsEmacs/">http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/AquamacsEmacs/</A></TT>.

<P>
The Aquamacs bug reporting address is now <TT><A NAME="tex2html56"
  HREF="mailto:aquamacs-bugs@aquamacs.org">mailto:aquamacs-bugs@aquamacs.org</A></TT>. This can be accessed from directly within the Aquamacs Help menu.

<P>
The general Aquamacs mailing list is still <TT><A NAME="tex2html57"
  HREF="mailto:macosx-emacs@email.esm.psu.edu">mailto:macosx-emacs@email.esm.psu.edu</A></TT>; e-mail <TT><A NAME="tex2html58"
  HREF="mailto:macosx-emacs-on@email.esm.psu.edu">mailto:macosx-emacs-on@email.esm.psu.edu</A></TT> to subscribe.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Slightly faster startup.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Runs on OS X 10.3.9, 10.4.0 and 10.4.---tested.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs automatically checks for updates and notifies the user
    if there is something new. This function communicates with an internet server; it does not
    transmit any information identifying the user. If you would like to
    know more about what is transmitted, use M-x
    aquamacs-check-version-information. If you like to turn this check off, add this to your file
 /Users/yourname/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el:

<P>
<TT>(setq aquamacs-version-check-url nil)</TT>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Adding Emacs packages is easier now: Emacs automatically finds
    packages in subdirectories within the /Library/<#1173#>Preferences| Application
    Support<#1173#>/<#1174#>Emacs|Aquamacs Emacs<#1174#>/ paths.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs now sets the file creator information of files it
    writes. This helps to open the file from Finder with Aquamacs when
    you double-click it. Feature can be turned off via customization
    option ``aquamacs-set-creator-codes-after-writing-files.''  Also,
    Emacs will appear in the Finder's context menu under ``Open With''
    for a lot of files that it is commonly used to edit.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>You can start Aquamacs in a terminal (by running
    /Applications/ Emacs.app /Contents/ MacOS/ Emacs) with parameter -nw
    and will show up in the terminal rather than as a  Carbon
    application. Basic file editing and all traditional commands
    work. However, Aquamacs-specific keyboard commands (with the
    Command key) will not work and other functionality may be limited,
    too. <I>Warning: </I>This mode of use, which may break in future versions, is not
    supported by the Aquamacs team.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We make sure that the *Completions* buffer (and similar things)
    open as a window inside the frame directly above the Minibuffer,
    and not in a new frame.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>All newly opened frames open in a somewhat useful position, so
they are not in the way. (If you do not like this, we suggest you set
    your own static frame positions via ``set current style as default''
    and also add this to your file /Users/yourname/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs
    Emacs/Preferences.el:

<P>
<TT> (setq smart-frame-positioning-enforce nil)</TT>

<P>
Or, if you would like to go with the default position all the time,
    turn the global minor mode off:

<P>
<TT>(smart-frame-positioning-mode nil)</TT>
</LI>
</UL>
