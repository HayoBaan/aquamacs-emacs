<p><a name="index-library-search-994"></a><a name="index-find-library-995"></a>
  When Emacs loads a Lisp library, it searches for the library
in a list of directories specified by the variable <code>load-path</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>load-path</b><var><a name="index-load_002dpath-996"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a list of directories to search when
loading files with <code>load</code>.  Each element is a string (which must be
a directory name) or <code>nil</code> (which stands for the current working
directory). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When Emacs starts up, it sets up the value of <code>load-path</code>
in several steps.  First, it initializes <code>load-path</code> using
default locations set when Emacs was compiled.  Normally, this
is a directory something like

<pre class="example">     "/usr/local/share/emacs/<var>version</var>/lisp"
</pre>
   <p>(In this and the following examples, replace <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> with
the installation prefix appropriate for your Emacs.) 
These directories contain the standard Lisp files that come with
Emacs.  If Emacs cannot find them, it will not start correctly.

   <p>If you run Emacs from the directory where it was built&mdash;that is, an
executable that has not been formally installed&mdash;Emacs instead
initializes <code>load-path</code> using the <samp><span class="file">lisp</span></samp>
directory in the directory containing the sources from which it
was built. 
<!-- Though there should be no *.el files in builddir/lisp, so it's pointless. -->
If you built Emacs in a separate directory from the
sources, it also adds the lisp directories from the build directory. 
(In all cases, elements are represented as absolute file names.)

   <p><a name="index-site_002dlisp-directories-997"></a>Unless you start Emacs with the <samp><span class="option">--no-site-lisp</span></samp> option,
it then adds two more <samp><span class="file">site-lisp</span></samp> directories to the front of
<code>load-path</code>.  These are intended for locally installed Lisp files,
and are normally of the form:

<pre class="example">     "/usr/local/share/emacs/<var>version</var>/site-lisp"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and

<pre class="example">     "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first one is for locally installed files for a specific Emacs
version; the second is for locally installed files meant for use
with all installed Emacs versions.  (If Emacs is running uninstalled,
it also adds <samp><span class="file">site-lisp</span></samp> directories from the source and build
directories, if they exist.  Normally these directories do not contain
<samp><span class="file">site-lisp</span></samp> directories.)

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bEMACSLOADPATH_007d-environment-variable-998"></a>If the environment variable <samp><span class="env">EMACSLOADPATH</span></samp> is set, it modifies
the above initialization procedure.  Emacs initializes
<code>load-path</code> based on the value of the environment variable.

   <p>The syntax of <samp><span class="env">EMACSLOADPATH</span></samp> is the same as used for <code>PATH</code>;
directory names are separated by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;, on some
operating systems). 
Here is an example of how to set <samp><span class="env">EMACSLOADPATH</span></samp> variable (from a
<samp><span class="command">sh</span></samp>-style shell):

<pre class="example">     export EMACSLOADPATH=/home/foo/.emacs.d/lisp:
</pre>
   <p>An empty element in the value of the environment variable, whether
trailing (as in the above example), leading, or embedded, is replaced
by the default value of <code>load-path</code> as determined by the standard
initialization procedure.  If there are no such empty elements, then
<samp><span class="env">EMACSLOADPATH</span></samp> specifies the entire <code>load-path</code>.  You must
include either an empty element, or the explicit path to the directory
containing the standard Lisp files, else Emacs will not function. 
(Another way to modify <code>load-path</code> is to use the <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp>
command-line option when starting Emacs; see below.)

   <p>For each directory in <code>load-path</code>, Emacs then checks to see if
it contains a file <samp><span class="file">subdirs.el</span></samp>, and if so, loads it.  The
<samp><span class="file">subdirs.el</span></samp> file is created when Emacs is built/installed,
and contains code that causes Emacs to add any subdirectories of those
directories to <code>load-path</code>.  Both immediate subdirectories and
subdirectories multiple levels down are added.  But it excludes
subdirectories whose names do not start with a letter or digit, and
subdirectories named <samp><span class="file">RCS</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">CVS</span></samp>, and subdirectories
containing a file named <samp><span class="file">.nosearch</span></samp>.

   <p>Next, Emacs adds any extra load directories that you specify using the
<samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> command-line option (see <a href="../emacs/Action-Arguments.html#Action-Arguments">Action Arguments</a>).  It also adds the directories where optional
packages are installed, if any (see <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>).

   <p>It is common to add code to one's init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>) to
add one or more directories to <code>load-path</code>.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (push "~/.emacs.d/lisp" load-path)
</pre>
   <p>Dumping Emacs uses a special value of <code>load-path</code>.  If you use
a <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp> file to customize the
dumped Emacs (see <a href="Building-Emacs.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a>), any changes to <code>load-path</code>
that these files make will be lost after dumping.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>locate-library</b><var> library &amp;optional nosuffix path interactive-call<a name="index-locate_002dlibrary-999"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command finds the precise file name for library <var>library</var>.  It
searches for the library in the same way <code>load</code> does, and the
argument <var>nosuffix</var> has the same meaning as in <code>load</code>: don't
add suffixes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>&rsquo; to the specified name
<var>library</var>.

        <p>If the <var>path</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that list of directories is used
instead of <code>load-path</code>.

        <p>When <code>locate-library</code> is called from a program, it returns the file
name as a string.  When the user runs <code>locate-library</code>
interactively, the argument <var>interactive-call</var> is <code>t</code>, and this
tells <code>locate-library</code> to display the file name in the echo area. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-shadowed-Lisp-files-1000"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>list-load-path-shadows</b><var> &amp;optional stringp<a name="index-list_002dload_002dpath_002dshadows-1001"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command shows a list of <dfn>shadowed</dfn> Emacs Lisp files.  A
shadowed file is one that will not normally be loaded, despite being
in a directory on <code>load-path</code>, due to the existence of another
similarly-named file in a directory earlier on <code>load-path</code>.

        <p>For instance, suppose <code>load-path</code> is set to

     <pre class="example">            ("/opt/emacs/site-lisp" "/usr/share/emacs/23.3/lisp")
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">and that both these directories contain a file named <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp>. 
Then <code>(require 'foo)</code> never loads the file in the second
directory.  Such a situation might indicate a problem in the way Emacs
was installed.

        <p>When called from Lisp, this function prints a message listing the
shadowed files, instead of displaying them in a buffer.  If the
optional argument <code>stringp</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, it instead returns
the shadowed files as a string.
