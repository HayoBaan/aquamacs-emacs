1 Aquamacs Emacs: a User-friendly Emacs Distribution</A>
</H1>

<P>
Aquamacs is an freely-available Aqua-native build of the powerful
Emacs text editor
(<TT><A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</A></TT>). By
``Aqua-native,'' we mean more than just the fact that this version of
Emacs runs as a standard OS X application. Aquamacs features extensive
customization that enables it to conform better with Apple's standard
Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) than standard versions of the editor
do.

<P>
Emacs is a text editor of legendary power and configurability, but it also has an enormously complex interface that, while consistent across platforms, is usually at odds with the specific interface conventions of the particular platform on which it is being used. The original GNU version of Emacs for the Mac, called Carbon Emacs, is no different.

<P>
Aquamacs Emacs implements the standard OS X keyboard shortcuts and other interface conventions, integrating Emacs into the Aqua environment to a far greater degree than other versions of Emacs. This allows Mac users who might be unfamiliar with Emacs' complex standard interface to harness its amazing editing power in a familiar way.

<P>
This documentation aims to introduce Aquamacs to novice users of Aquamacs Emacs, to help them get started with this powerful text editor. The documentation also aims to introduce Aquamacs to experienced users of Emacs, who may find aspects of its interface inconsistent with their experience.

<P>
The Aquamacs documentation will focus on the following areas:
