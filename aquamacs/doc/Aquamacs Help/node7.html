3 In Depth: The Aquamacs Interface</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this section, we will walk through the Aquamacs interface step by step, and will introduce relevant points about how Aquamacs Emacs solves particular editing problems in a distinctive way. We will specifically emphasize the functions that Aquamacs offers as opposed to GNU Emacs, which readers might be familiar with anyways.
