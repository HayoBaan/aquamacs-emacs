3.5.2.1 Inputting characters with the Option key on non-English
  keyboards.</A>
</H4> In most non-English keyboard layouts, the Option key
also serves to input characters such as <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline277# or <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline279# or
@. Using Option as Meta would inhibit you from inputting those
characters. You have three options to get around this. <I>Either</I>,
you deselect ``Option Key for Meta'' in the Options menu (under
``Option Key''), in which case you will have to use ESC for Meta,
<I>or</I> you toggle back and forth between the modes using Command-;,
<I>or</I> you use Option for Meta, but enable one of the emulation
modes provided in the same menu under ``Option Key''.  For those keyboard layouts supported, <B>this option is the most convenient</B>.  The emulation will allow
you to input all common characters with the Option key, while using Option for Meta in general. 

<P>
Alternatively, Aquamacs allows you to use another modifier key -- such
as the Function key on laptops. The customization group ``Aquamacs''
contains appropriate settings, reachable via the menu items in Options / Customize Emacs.
