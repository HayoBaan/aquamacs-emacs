7 Getting Help</A>
</H1>

<P>
There are many options for getting help with Aquamacs.

<P>
From within Aquamacs, you can access user documentation from the menu or from specific key combinations.  This manual is available from the Help menu, as is a very complete Emacs documentation, the <I>Emacs Manual</I>.  To extend Emacs using the built-in programming language Emacs Lisp, refer to the <I>Emacs Lisp Reference</I>, which is also available from the Help menu.  (The latter can be used via the Mac's convenient Help Books, or via Emacs' powerful Info interface.)

<P>
Emacs is self-documenting.  The Help menu (under <I>Describe</I>) contains documentation for every function available to the user.  You can reach these functions easily: <#247#><TT>C-h k</TT><#247#> (plus key/menu entry) brings up help for any key or menu binding; <#248#><TT>C-h f</TT><#248#> (plus function name) gives help for an elisp function; autocompletion support is available with (tab); and <#249#><TT>C-h a</TT><#249#> brings up apropos, a search function.

<P>
For help from other Aquamacs/Emacs users, the best place to begin is the OS X Emacs mailing list. The searchable list archives are located at <TT><A NAME="tex2html22"
  HREF="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.macintosh.osx">http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.macintosh.osx</A></TT>. For more information on subscribing to the list, see <TT><A NAME="tex2html23"
  HREF="http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-emacs">http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-emacs</A></TT>.  Another option for general Emacs help is the gnu.emacs.help newsgroup.

<P>
Remember: almost every question has been asked before.  Google will give you an instant answer, provided you know the right keywords.

<P>
Apart from answering questions at the OS X Emacs mailing list, you can also file bug reports on Aquamacs. Use the ``Send Bug Report'' function in the Help / Diagnose and Report Bug menu.  The same menu has a function to restart Aquamacs without any of your customizations -- please use this function to ensure that it is really a bug in Aquamacs that you are seeing.  (Your settings may be flawless, but even so we'd like to know which ones will cause the bug to show up!)

<P>
In addition to requesting help, you can also offer it in these mailing lists. <I>Please note that in case we have helped you with a configuration problem on the mailing list, we may ask you to write a little note in the Aquamacs Wiki so others can profit, too.</I> Remember: Aquamacs is an Open Source community project!
