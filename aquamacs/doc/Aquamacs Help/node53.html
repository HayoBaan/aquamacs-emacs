14.10 Changes--- 2.1</A>

<LI>Aquamacs is now optimized further for speed on machines with Intel processors: It starts up faster and also executes lisp faster (up to 50<tex2html_percent_mark> in some situations).
</LI>
<LI>The ``Line Numbers'' item in the Options/View menu now turns on `global-linum-mode', displaying line numbers to the left of each buffer line.
Suggested by Konrad Podczeck.
</LI>
<LI>Copying bug reports and other mail to the pasteboard in order to send them with GMail or another mail program now works reliably.
Reported by Matt Mollison. <tex2html_comment_mark>8
</LI>
<LI>C-x s (`save-some-buffers') and other functions that ask questions applying to a series of items accept the <#971#><TT>!</TT><#971#> command again to apply the action to all items (e.g., save all buffers).
Reported by Michael Kohlhase.
</LI>
<LI>Users should now experience no more trouble binding the new Aquamacs version to file types with the Finder's ``Open With'' and ``Change all'' functions when earlier versions of Aquamacs are present.  In case of persistent issues, we advise to reset the LaunchServices database with the `lsregister' command as described here:  <TT><A NAME="tex2html43"

</LI>
<LI>The Spellchecking context menu (flyspell-mode / Check Spelling While Typing) now shows suggested alternatives in the right order. 
</LI>
<LI>The LaTeX icon in the toolbar changes again when toggling PDF mode.
Reported by Gabriel Cardona and Konrad Podczeck.
</LI>
<LI>Jumping to the exact source/PDF position with Skim now works even in multi-file LaTeX projects where files are in different locations.  
Reported by Brad Miller and Jeffery Kline.
</LI>
<LI>Setting frame position and size in `default-frame-alist' (and elsewhere) now works again.
Reported by Konrad Podczeck.
</LI>
<LI>Fixed ``Join Windows'' menu item (was: ``Remove Splits'').
</LI>
<LI>PHP-mode has been updated to version 1.5.0.
</LI>
<LI>Files opened from the command line or via the Finder will be shown if they are already visible in a tab or in any other window;  unless `Show Buffers in New Frames' (one-buffer-one-frame-mode) is enabled, Aquamacs no longer creates a new frame for those files.  The customization variable `dnd-open-file-other-window'  can be used to control the behavior.
Reported by Mike Pelican.
</LI>
<LI>With all frames closed, minimized or on other spaces, Aquamacs now recognizes key commands again.  If the minibuffer is needed, a frame showing an <I>empty</I> buffer will appear.  This buffer is always read-only and, unsurprisingly, rather empty.
</LI>
<LI>Frames are now cycled in order of their last selection, rather than their creation.  Selecting a frame and deleting it will, for instance, select the previously selected frame.  Cycling with A-` (`next-frame')  will cycle accordingly.
Reported by Konrad Podczeck and David Eyk.
</LI>
<LI>Haskell-mode has been updated to version 2.7.0.
Suggested by Johannes Krause.
</LI>
<LI>Menu-bar-mode, not supported in Aquamacs, will no longer cause problems for people who try to switch the menu bar off in their customizations.
</LI>
<LI>The cursor is now drawn correctly when `line-spacing' is set.
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs no longer hangs in some situations when using `ispell'.
</LI>
