  <h2><a name="SECTION0001529000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION0001529000000000000000">14.29 Changes--0.9.7</a></h2>

  <ul>
    <li><i>S</i>ummary: New functions: Mac-style printing, Export
    to PDF and HTML, Spelling suggestions, New buffer in mode /
    change major mode menus, a context menu (right mouse click),
    speed improvements, nXML and AUCTeX included text display
    improved (international characters and proportional fonts),
    "wrong command-p" bug fixed and much more.</li>

    <li>Printing: Aquamacs now supports full What-you-see-is-what-
    you-get printing. Choose 'Preview and Print' from the File
    menu, and the current buffer (or the current region, if one is
    marked) is typeset using the color theme and the syntax
    coloring that is active. You can then preview or print it with
    the standard Mac OS X printing dialogs, selecting a standard
    Mac printer. (Output to US Letter format only at this point.
    Sorry!)</li>

    <li>Export to PDF and HTML: The current buffer (or a region if
    selected) can now be exported to a PDF or HTML file. Syntax
    coloring (and the chosen color theme except for the background
    color) are respected.</li>

    <li>LaTeX: Aquamacs now comes with the latest version of
    AUCTeX, which will allow you to most comfortably edit LaTeX
    source code and even preview some of the results (e.g.
    formulas) directly in your document. No need to install an
    additional AUCTeX package. AUCTeX already works out-of-the box.

      <p>It is recommended that you remove any previous
      installations of AUCTeX.</p>
    </li>

    <li>nXML: Edit XML code more comfortably with the included
    nxml-mode. It validates the document as you type. If you don't
    like the mode, the following in your Preferences.el file will
    bring the old XML mode back:
      <pre>
(assq-set-equal "&lt;\\?xml " 'xml-mode
                           'magic-mode-alist)
</pre>

      <p>Suggestion from Tim Bray.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Speed: Aquamacs is a little faster now when opening new
    frames, when frame appearance styles have been defined.</li>

    <li>Right-Mouse-clicks in text now bring up a context menu
    which allows you to copy/paste, search the word under the mouse
    in Google or look it up in the system dictionary and switch the
    buffer.</li>

    <li>Control-Mouse-click is always mapped to mouse-3 (right
    mouse button) now so Apple mouse and laptop users will
    consistently get the same functionality. To do mouse-2, just
    hold down the Command key while clicking. (This does
    mouse-yank-at-click, a useful functionality that you might be
    used to from Linux / X11 machines!)</li>

    <li>Alt-Mouse-click&amp;drag allows you to select a secondary
    selection. (This used to be on Command-mouse-1-drag.)</li>

    <li>Spelling correction (flyspell) will make suggestions upon
    right-clicking on a misspelled word.</li>

    <li>Fonts/Display: Aquamacs Emacs can now display an even wider
    range of characters with any font available on OS X. Some
    characters will look nicer. Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu</li>

    <li>Text Display: Aquamacs now displays text in variable-width
    fonts with much better letter-spacing. It'll look like in other
    OS X apps, and reading and editing long texts is much more fun
    now. Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu</li>

    <li>Navigation in wrapped lines (not word wrap) is easier now:
    arrow keys will jump to the next visual line, not to the next
    buffer/file line. Also, navigation is visual now for variable
    width fonts like Lucida: jumping up or down moves to roughly
    the same place in the adjacent line going after what's
    displayed on the screen rather than counting characters
    (jumping to the same row number in the next line). If you don't
    like the behavior, you can turn it off with this code in your
    Preferences.el / .emacs file:
      <pre>
(define-key osx-key-mode-map [remap previous-line]
            'previous-line)

(define-key osx-key-mode-map [remap next-line]
            'next-line)
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Scrolling and setting the point with the mouse has
    improved: `scroll-margin' defaults to 0 now, so scrolling won't
    happen until you've reached the first or last line in the
    window - except when you use the cursor up/down keys (and
    osx-key-mode is on). Then, scrolling takes place a few lines
    before you reach the boundary. You can configure this via
    Aquamacs' customization variable `visual-scroll-margin'.</li>

    <li>Command-{ comments the line or the region (in programming
    modes)</li>

    <li>Command-} uncomments the line or the region (in programming
    modes)</li>

    <li>Command-' comments or uncomments (toggling) the line or the
    region (in programming modes)</li>

    <li>Command-Delete kills (erases) the rest of the current line.
    (Command-Backspace kills the whole line.)</li>

    <li>Filenames with spaces can now be entered without
    hassle.</li>

    <li>Modifier-Key configuration: Several previously deprecated
    variables have been removed: `mac-reverse-ctrl-meta' and
    'mac-command-key-is-meta'. Use the much simpler, yet equally
    powerful variables `mac-command-modifier',
    `mac-option-modifier', `mac-control-modifier' and
    `mac-function-modifier' (experimental) instead. Additionally,
    `mac-pass-option-to-system' is deprecated now: instead, set
    `mac-option-modifier' to nil to reach the same effect. The use
    of the Option menu is recommended.

      <p>To set the Apple key to Meta (not recommended), add this
      to your Preferences.el file:</p>

      <p>tt (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)</p>
    </li>

    <li>Fn-key can act as Meta. If you have an Fn key on your
    laptop, you can use it as Meta key now. Add this to your
    Preferences.el file:

      <p><tt>(setq mac-function-modifier 'meta)</tt></p>

      <p>Note that support of the Fn key is experimental. Rare
      combinations may fail on non-English keyboard layouts, and
      some keys will not work correctly in combination with Fn and
      Shift.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Modifier keys such as Command or Shift show up correctly in
    the shortcuts (menu)</li>

    <li>New-Buffer menu contains many more modes now, such as modes
    for Fortran, ObjectiveC, C++, PHP, CSS, JavaScript... You can
    add your own in the customization variable
    `aquamacs-known-major-modes'. The menu is updated
    automatically.</li>

    <li>Change-Buffer-Mode menu (in File menu) allows to change the
    mode of the current buffer to something hopefully more
    useful.</li>

    <li>Recently used major modes are now displayed in New-Buffer
    and Change-Buffer-Mode menus .</li>

    <li>M-w (kill-ring-save) will now deactivate the mark after
    saving the region, that is deselect the region, just like on
    standard Emacs. Apple-C will not deselect the region, just like
    it's done on the Mac.</li>

    <li>Run executables from within Emacs that lie in your PATH as
    set in shell init files. Aquamacs will set `exec-path'
    automatically from PATH. We don't add paths to exec-path any
    more (except one default tetex path for AUCTeX).</li>

    <li>Questions like "Save to file before closing?" will be asked
    with a proper dialog and not with a menu appearing out of
    nothing - if the last action was carried out with the mouse.

      <p>Thanks to CarbonEmacsJP project for part of this.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Info mode: C-h i will bring up not only up-to-date info
    nodes for Emacs, but also info on installed packages on the
    system. (unless you have an INFOPATH environment variable
    set)</li>

    <li>Mode-specific styles: With a new menu function, you can now
    apply the style assigned to some other mode, effectively
    copying it over.</li>

    <li>Mode-specific styles are not applied any more for the
    major-mode of buffers shown in temporary windows inside frames
    such as the</li>

    <li>Completions* buffer. This prevents ugly font-switching etc.
    for the whole frame when just a small window is opened inside
    the frame.</li>

    <li>New Packages: findr, htmlize, ruby's friends, auctex
    (latex-mode), nxml-mode, matlab-mode, javascript-mode,</li>

    <li>Notable Updated external packages: ruby-mode, ruby-*,
    carbon-font</li>

    <li>Apple/Command key is now called 'A-' internally because it
    looks like "Apple-" (while it's really the otherwise unused
    "Alt" key). It used to be "H-" (or: hyper), so change your
    configuration code in case you've defined your own
    shortcuts.</li>

    <li>One-Buffer-One-Frame is a minor mode now (called
    one-buffer-one-frame-mode). Use the Options menu (and Save
    Options) to turn it on/off, as before. In this minor mode, you
    have some additional key bindings now:

      <p>C-x B, C-x C-B, C-x S-left, C-x S-right they all do the
      same as their corresponding functions without the Shift key,
      but they will show the buffer that they are switching to in
      the same window, even though one-buffer-one-frame-mode is
      on.</p>

      <p>The mode has been revised to open fewer extra windows when
      their content is related to a specific frame - for example
      version control checkin comments.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Manual: The Emacs Manual that comes with Aquamacs (as an
    Apple Help document) has been updated to reflect the basis of
    Aquamacs, namely the upcoming Emacs 22.</li>

    <li>Command-p-Bugfix: For some users, Emacs locked up at random
    times, showing a message like (wrong command-p ...) in the echo
    area of a frame on every input. This bug in the underlying GNU
    Emacs should be fixed now. Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu,
    Richard Stallman, et al.</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Aquamacs now correctly remembers the positions of
    frames with specific files, so they open again on the same
    screen position if the file is re-loaded (in the same session,
    or after "Save Options" in the next session).</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Bookmarks did not work with `one-buffer-one-frame'
    turned on.</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Some Show/Hide options weren't saved by "Save
    Options".</li>

    <li>Bugfix: links from describe-variable/function help buffers
    to the source files are correct now for the Aquamacs-specific
    objects</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Aquamacs works fine now on systems where, in the
    default shell (e.g. via .bash profile), functions have been
    defined and exported. Reported by Terry Jones</li>

    <li>Bugfix: RefTeX mode does't give constant audio signals
    (errors) any more in certain situations</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Allout mode should work again (saving files)
    Reported by Gerry Brush Patch by Ken Mannheimer</li>
  </ul>
