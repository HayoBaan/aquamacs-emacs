6.1 Plug-in Interface</A>
</H2>

<P>
All files named <I>site-start.el</I> anywhere in the load-path are loaded at startup, before the user's init files are loaded. For example, such a file may be placed in the user's Library folder, that is in 
<BR><#192#><TT>/Library/Application~Support/Aquamacs~Emacs/myPlugin</TT><#192#>. 

<P>
The load-path is automatically extended to cover all subdirectories in standard paths (see Section <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#standardpaths#193><tex2html_cr_mark></A>).

<P>
If a plug-in needs to execute code earlier in the initialization phase, that is, before any Aquamacs- specific code is executed (but after Emacs initilization code has been executed), this code can be provided in a file <I>site-prestart.el</I> anywhere in the load-path.

<P>
Info files (M-x info) can be provided in a directory called <#195#><TT>info</TT><#195#> inside the plugin directory. Aquamacs will automatically add this path to `Info-default-directory-list'. Plugins should provide a <#196#><TT>dir</TT><#196#> file inside the <#197#><TT>info</TT><#197#> directory containing an overview (see the Emacs documentation for `info').

<P>
Note that plug-ins should not make any assumptions about whether a frame exists or is visible.

<P>
