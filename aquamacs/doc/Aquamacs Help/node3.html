1.1 Terminology in this Manual</A>
</H2>

<P>
GNU Emacs uses a terminology that is different from what users of modern, graphical environments are used to. Windows become <I>frames</I>, and documents are held in <I>buffers</I>. We will concentrate on the Emacs terminology in this manual in places where this is not confusing.

<P>
Aquamacs Emacs is an extensive <I>distribution</I> of GNU Emacs with modified defaults -- almost up to the point where it could be called a <I>fork</I> - a completely new program. However, Aquamacs always contains the latest version of GNU Emacs. It is useful to understand the relationship between Emacs and Aquamacs. In this manual, we will use the term <I>Emacs</I> to refer to the core which is used on many different operating systems and built and distributed by the GNU Project. We will use the term <I>Aquamacs Emacs</I> (or just <I>Aquamacs</I>) to refer to the present implementation.

<P>
