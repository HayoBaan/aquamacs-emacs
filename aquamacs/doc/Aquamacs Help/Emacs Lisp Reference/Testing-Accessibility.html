  These functions test for permission to access a file for reading,
writing, or execution.  Unless explicitly stated otherwise, they
recursively follow symbolic links for their file name arguments, at
all levels (at the level of the file itself and at all levels of
parent directories).

   <p>On some operating systems, more complex sets of access permissions
can be specified, via mechanisms such as Access Control Lists (ACLs). 
See <a href="Extended-Attributes.html#Extended-Attributes">Extended Attributes</a>, for how to query and set those
permissions.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-exists-p</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dexists_002dp-2080"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if a file named <var>filename</var> appears
to exist.  This does not mean you can necessarily read the file, only
that you can find out its attributes.  (On Unix and GNU/Linux, this is
true if the file exists and you have execute permission on the
containing directories, regardless of the permissions of the file
itself.)

        <p>If the file does not exist, or if access control policies prevent you
from finding its attributes, this function returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>Directories are files, so <code>file-exists-p</code> returns <code>t</code> when
given a directory name.  However, symbolic links are treated
specially; <code>file-exists-p</code> returns <code>t</code> for a symbolic link
name only if the target file exists. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-readable-p</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dreadable_002dp-2081"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if a file named <var>filename</var> exists
and you can read it.  It returns <code>nil</code> otherwise. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-executable-p</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dexecutable_002dp-2082"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if a file named <var>filename</var> exists and
you can execute it.  It returns <code>nil</code> otherwise.  On Unix and
GNU/Linux, if the file is a directory, execute permission means you can
check the existence and attributes of files inside the directory, and
open those files if their modes permit. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-writable-p</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dwritable_002dp-2083"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if the file <var>filename</var> can be written
or created by you, and <code>nil</code> otherwise.  A file is writable if the
file exists and you can write it.  It is creatable if it does not exist,
but the specified directory does exist and you can write in that
directory.

        <p>In the example below, <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> is not writable because the parent
directory does not exist, even though the user could create such a
directory.

     <pre class="example">          (file-writable-p "~/no-such-dir/foo")
               &rArr; nil
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-accessible-directory-p</b><var> dirname<a name="index-file_002daccessible_002ddirectory_002dp-2084"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if you have permission to open existing
files in the directory whose name as a file is <var>dirname</var>;
otherwise (or if there is no such directory), it returns <code>nil</code>. 
The value of <var>dirname</var> may be either a directory name (such as
<samp><span class="file">/foo/</span></samp>) or the file name of a file which is a directory
(such as <samp><span class="file">/foo</span></samp>, without the final slash).

        <p>For example, from the following we deduce that any attempt to read a
file in <samp><span class="file">/foo/</span></samp> will give an error:

     <pre class="example">          (file-accessible-directory-p "/foo")
               &rArr; nil
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>access-file</b><var> filename string<a name="index-access_002dfile-2085"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function opens file <var>filename</var> for reading, then closes it and
returns <code>nil</code>.  However, if the open fails, it signals an error
using <var>string</var> as the error message text. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-ownership-preserved-p</b><var> filename &amp;optional group<a name="index-file_002downership_002dpreserved_002dp-2086"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if deleting the file <var>filename</var> and
then creating it anew would keep the file's owner unchanged.  It also
returns <code>t</code> for nonexistent files.

        <p>If the optional argument <var>group</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function
also checks that the file's group would be unchanged.

        <p>If <var>filename</var> is a symbolic link, then, unlike the other functions
discussed here, <code>file-ownership-preserved-p</code> does <em>not</em>
replace <var>filename</var> with its target.  However, it does recursively
follow symbolic links at all levels of parent directories. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-modes</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dmodes-2087"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-mode-bits-2088"></a><a name="index-file-permissions-2089"></a><a name="index-permissions_002c-file-2090"></a><a name="index-file-modes-2091"></a>This function returns the <dfn>mode bits</dfn> of <var>filename</var>&mdash;an
integer summarizing its read, write, and execution permissions. 
Symbolic links in <var>filename</var> are recursively followed at all
levels.  If the file does not exist, the return value is <code>nil</code>.

        <p>See <a href="../coreutils/File-permissions.html#File-permissions">File permissions</a>, for a description of mode bits.  For example, if the
low-order bit is 1, the file is executable by all users; if the
second-lowest-order bit is 1, the file is writable by all users; etc. 
The highest possible value is 4095 (7777 octal), meaning that everyone
has read, write, and execute permission, the <acronym>SUID</acronym> bit is set
for both others and group, and the sticky bit is set.

        <p>See <a href="Changing-Files.html#Changing-Files">Changing Files</a>, for the <code>set-file-modes</code> function, which
can be used to set these permissions.

     <pre class="example">          (file-modes "~/junk/diffs")
               &rArr; 492               ; <span class="roman">Decimal integer.</span>
          (format "%o" 492)
               &rArr; "754"             ; <span class="roman">Convert to octal.</span>
          
          (set-file-modes "~/junk/diffs" #o666)
               &rArr; nil
          
          $ ls -l diffs

</pre>
        <p><a name="index-MS_002dDOS-and-file-modes-2092"></a><a name="index-file-modes-and-MS_002dDOS-2093"></a><strong>MS-DOS note:</strong> On MS-DOS, there is no such thing as an
executable file mode bit.  So <code>file-modes</code> considers a file
executable if its name ends in one of the standard executable
extensions, such as <samp><span class="file">.com</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.bat</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.exe</span></samp>, and some
others.  Files that begin with the Unix-standard &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>&rsquo; signature,
such as shell and Perl scripts, are also considered executable. 
Directories are also reported as executable, for compatibility with
Unix.  These conventions are also followed by <code>file-attributes</code>
(see <a href="File-Attributes.html#File-Attributes">File Attributes</a>).
