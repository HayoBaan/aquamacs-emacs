<LI>No more (delay due to) tramp mode on startup in cases where tramp
    mode had been used before (recentf).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Files on externally mounted volumes are not checked for readability
    any more for exclusion from recent files list.
    (Reported by Bill Clementson)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>No more warnings when fonts are missing (on startup).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Drag and Drop while in minibuffer works again.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mouse-2 works again.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>default-major-mode and initial-major-mode are respected now.
    initial-frame-alist is not modified any more.
    Note that other than in any standard Emacs, mode-specific settings
    always take precedence over default-frame-alist (but not over
    initial-frame-alist).
    (Reported by Rick Zaccone, Joe Davison and Peter Dyballa)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>No more warnings in customization buffers that the values have
    been changed outside customize (for certain variables).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Gnus articles (newsreader) open in same frame now.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Gnus has a useful (free) nntp server set so you can start right
    away.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Send Email with Sendmail is gone from menu (doesn't usually work
    on  OS X).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fonts corrected: Some glyphs in some fonts turned out wrong when
    in bold or italic. Also, font sizes are correct again (Lucida 14
    is Lucida Grande 14, not 12 or so). The default font size for
    text-mode (and similar ones) is set to Lucida 13 to make up for
    the change.  Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause with
    your default settings. (Reported by William Henney)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Better customization for aquamacs-mode-specific-default-themes

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The customizations file (customizations.el) doesn't grow any more.
    (Reported by Alastair Rankine.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Various corrections in the Aquamacs Manual.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Plugin support: All files named site-start.el anywhere in the load-path
    are loaded at startup, before the user's init files are
    loaded. For example, such a file may be placed in
    ~/Library/Application Support/Aquamacs Emacs/myPlugin. This
    feature enables support for easily installable plugins.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We anticipate shorter startup times in the next release. Stay tuned.
