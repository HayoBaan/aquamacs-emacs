  <p class="c1">Display</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tabs are now on by default in new installations. ``Show
    buffers in new frames'' ( one-buffer-one-frame-mode) is off by
    default. Use the Options menu if you'd like to configure
    different settings. (That users who had previously installed
    and configured Aquamacs will retain their chosen settings.) Tab
    code by Nathaniel Cunningham, David&nbsp;Ponce and David
    Reitter.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs Styles have seen a major overhaul and are now
    called <em>Aquamacs Autofaces</em>. To recap, these autofaces
    apply settings such as fonts, background and foreground colors
    to buffers and the frames as they show the buffers. The
    settings are chosen according to the major mode used in the
    buffer. This makes is possibly to automatically edit prose
    texts (such as LaTeX) in a variable-width (proportional) font,
    but do one's programming (e.g., Python or C) in a fixed-width
    font. Refer below for a technical explanation of the
    change.</li>

    <li>The use of color themes is being phased out. While still
    included in Aquamacs, they are not available any longer from
    the Options menu. We recommend the new light-weight functions
    to set fore/background colors using the Options / Appearance
    menu.</li>

    <li>Fontsets are no longer defined on startup (with a few
    exceptions to ease the transition). If your frame settings
    (`default-frame-alist' and `special-display-frame-alist')
    contain references to fontsets like <tt>fontset-monaco12</tt>,
    we recommend to remove them, e.g., via M-x
    customize-option.</li>

    <li>The font used for text in the echo area (the `default'
    face) is now Lucida 13pt, as is customary on the Mac. Note that
    the size of this font is used to express frame geometry
    settings, so this may need manual adjustment. The font used for
    major modes that do not have a special setting (the
    `autoface-default' face) is Monaco, so that buffers are
    generally shown in a monospaced font. The default for certain
    other modes such as `text-mode' (face: `text-mode-default') and
    `latex-mode' (face: `latex-mode-default') is Lucida 13pt. You
    may change these settings using the font settings in the
    Options / Appearance menu, and also using M-x
    customize-face.</li>

    <li>There is a new function (in Options / Appearance) that will
    ``Adopt the frame parameters as default'' for all new frames.
    Note that this will set `default-frame-alist' (or
    `special-display-frame-alist'). These settings will be saved in
    the customizations file with ``Save Options''. Emacs hackers
    need to be aware that such customization settings override any
    settings in <tt>.emacs</tt> files (but not those in
    <tt>Preferences.el</tt>).</li>

    <li>Zoom: press Command-+ (or Command-=) to zoom in, and
    Command-{}- to zoom out, changing the font size of the text
    shown. You can also use your Meta key (normally Option) and the
    mouse wheel. This zoom applies just to a buffer and frame.</li>

    <li>The line where the point (cursor) is can be highlighted
    with `highline-mode', available via Option / Show/Hide /
    Highlight Lines (`global-highline-mode'). Code by Vinicius Jose
    Latorre.</li>

    <li>Fringes now blend with the rest of the window (background
    color). Customize the `fringe' face if you'd like more
    pronounced fringes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="c1">Configuring and Extending Aquamacs</p>

  <ul>
    <li>New (text-mode) buffers will have soft word wrap enabled
    (rather than hard auto-fill mode), in line with the standard
    way of text editing on the Mac. Soft word wrap is also used for
    opened files as a default, when the wrapping mode cannot be
    determined automatically. (Customize
    `auto-word-wrap-default-function' to nil to change this
    back.)</li>

    <li>More user-installed files (in the <tt>/Library</tt> and
    <tt>/Users/.../Library</tt> folders now take precedence over
    Aquamacs-supplied packages. Specifically, user-supplied
    packages contained in subdirectories, including an AUCTeX
    distribution (must be compiled) are loaded when present. Thus,
    almost all packages that come with Aquamacs can now be
    replaced. Warning: supplying your own packages may cause
    errors.</li>

    <li>A new function in the Tools menu will install a small tool
    that allows users to open files in Aquamacs from a shell
    (command-line / Terminal). The command format is <tt>aquamacs
    filename.txt</tt>.</li>

    <li>The Options menu has been restructured. You can now find
    the functions ``Enter Debugger on Error'' and ``Enter Debugger
    on Quit'' in the ``Help / Diagnose and Report Bug''
    sub-menu.</li>

    <li>When started from a shell (e.g. in a terminal),
    `default-directory' will be the inherited from the shell.
    Reported by Robert Goldman.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs can now automatically select the frame and window
    over which you move your mouse cursor, as provided by Apple's
    Terminal.app and by many X11-based window managers under Unix
    and GNU/Linux. We now include the `follow-mouse' package with a
    few extensions to make it work on the Mac. You can turn it on
    with a simple<br />
    <tt>(turn-on-follow-mouse)</tt> in your Preferences.el
    file.</li>

    <li>The ``vl'' indicator in the mode-line has been removed.
    `global-visual-line-mode' is on by default in Aquamacs.</li>

    <li>The mode-line now shows ``Wrap'' to indicate that soft word
    wrapping (`word-wrap') is on in the buffer. Word wrapping can
    be toggled with C-x w now.</li>

    <li>There is a new menu item to customize Aquamacs-specific
    options (as compared to GNU Emacs defaults) in the Options /
    Customize Aquamacs menu.</li>

    <li>To see only labels (and not icons or icons and labels) in
    the tool-bar, use this setting in your <tt>Preferences.el</tt>
    file:

      <p><tt>(setq mac-tool-bar-display-mode 'labels)</tt></p>

      <p>Note that this used to cause labels and icons to be
      displayed. The variable value for labels and icons is now
      <tt>both</tt>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Note that the `cl' library is no longer loaded by any of
    the default packages that come with Aquamacs. As a result, you
    may need to insert <tt>(require 'cl)</tt> into your
    <tt>Preferences.el</tt> file to load this package manually if
    you use any of the Lisp style functions or macros provided
    therein.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="c1">Major Modes</p>

  <ul>
    <li>SLIME, the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode is no longer
    included in Aquamacs but provided as a point-and-click
    installer plugin, which can be downloaded from the Aquamacs
    website. The SLIME developers do not release validated
    versions; the SLIME plugins available from the Aquamacs website
    are development builds that are updated regularly.</li>

    <li>Wikipedia mode (version 1.5 plus Aquamacs modification)
    included. This can be used to edit text for Wikipedia and other
    Mediawiki wikis. Start with M-x wikipedia-mode. Code by Chong
    Yidong, Uwe Brauer.</li>

    <li>Python mode has been updated to use `python-mode' (as found
    on Launchpad). Reported by Jin Choi. Python-mode Code
    maintained by Barry Warsaw. Research by Skip Montanaro.</li>

    <li>Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) has been updated to version
    5.3.10 (was: 5.3.6). Refer to the ESS website for changes (
    <span class="c2"><tt><a name="tex2html62" href=
    "http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/readme.html#New-Features" id=
    "tex2html62">http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/readme.html#New-Features</a></tt></span>).</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="c1">Bugfixes and Miscellany</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Aquamacs has a smaller footprint; The download is about
    7&nbsp;MBytes smaller; the installed program about
    4&nbsp;MBytes.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs will now start up again for use in a terminal (-nw
    argument). Reported by Ian Soboroff.</li>

    <li>The ``Check for Updates'' menu item in the Aquamacs menu
    should work in all circumstances now.</li>

    <li>Fullscreen mode (A-S-Return, or Window menu) works again on
    all secondary displays.</li>

    <li>Dragging and dropping more than one file or opening several
    files from a terminal with Aquamacs with tabbar-mode will now
    lead to all files being shown in tabs, not just the last
    one.</li>

    <li>Command-1 (`aquamacs-delete-other-windows') no longer hides
    the tabbar in certain circumstances.</li>

    <li>Re-opening files already shown in a buffer or switching to
    buffers will bring up their tab, even if the tab is shown in
    another frame.</li>

    <li>An issue was addressed that could lead to the wrong tab
    being selected after killing or renaming a buffer. The problem
    was evident with `find-alternate-file'. Reported by Tao
    Peng.</li>

    <li>C-e (end-of-visual-line) will now work correctly in the
    last line of a buffer that does not end with a newline.
    Reported by Raymond Namyst.</li>

    <li>Command/Control-left/right will jump to the beginning or
    end of the visual line, respectively, rather than to the
    beginning or end of the buffer line. Reported by
    Jean-Christophe Helary.</li>

    <li>When soft word wrap (`word-wrap') is off (see Options
    menu), then C-k (kill-visual-line) and Command-Backspace
    (kill-whole-visual-line) now behave like their non-visual
    counter-parts, i.e. they delete the whole (rest of the) buffer
    line, rather than the visual line. This is in line with the
    extant behavior of C-a and C-e. Reported by Tom van Vleck.</li>

    <li>When Aquamacs is given files from the command line or by
    some drag'n'drop event while no frames are shown, it now only
    shows a new or pre-existing frame with the new file(s) rather
    than two frames. Reporter unknown (thanks for letting us know
    though).</li>

    <li>Page-wise scrolling (PgUp, M-up, aquamacs-page-up and
    friends) now works correctly when faces with different sizes
    are used in buffers, such as in LaTeX-mode. (Note that the
    `pager' package is not used any longer. While the screen
    position of the cursor should be preserved in most cases, this
    is not perfect. `pager' can still be activated using
    <tt>(require 'pager)</tt> in Preferences.el.</li>

    <li>C-a (beginning-of-visual-line in `visual-line-mode' which
    is the default) will now always skip a prompt (e.g., in
    shell-mode) at the beginning of the line.</li>

    <li>Moving the cursor up and down failed in certain situations
    involving side-by-side windows in a frame. Reported by Jin
    Choi.</li>

    <li>Beginning/End-of-line movement commands don't signal an
    error any longer in visual line mode (so there is also no echo
    area message).</li>

    <li>Functions like `enlarge-frame' are bound to
    A-C-left/right/up/down (Command-Control) in all cases (and
    depend on osx-key-mode).</li>

    <li>The mouse cursor changes its shape when over buffer
    text.</li>

    <li>The Options / Show/Hide menu is now called View. Suggested
    by Jean-Christophe Helary.</li>

    <li>Changed fringe mode is now recongized when options are
    saved. The fringe menu was revised.</li>

    <li>Options -&gt; Save Options will always save the options now
    (whether considered needed or not).</li>

    <li>Scrolling with the mouse wheel now works without first
    selecting the frame - just move the mouse cursor over the
    window. (N.B., `mouse-wheel-follow-mouse' only applies to
    windows, not to frames.)</li>

    <li>Maintaining full-screen frames across sessions works again;
    as does opening additional frames when the current frame is in
    full-screen mode.</li>

    <li>`ediff' (Tools menu, under ``Compare'') no longer brings up
    additional controller frames. This fix may also improve the
    function of other modes that use a complex set of frames. (By
    popular demand.)</li>

    <li>Info-mode is now compatible with the tabbar.</li>

    <li>Desktop-save-mode does not open additional scratch buffers
    any longer. Reported by Ivan Werning.</li>

    <li>Auto-save files (usually named <tt>#filename#</tt>) are now
    saved in a temporary directory, out of sight of the user.</li>

    <li>We forgot to offer to save newly created buffers when
    removing them (Command-W (close-buffer) or killing) after their
    major mode was changed.</li>

    <li>Showing a dired buffer with ``Show Buffers in New Frames''
    (one-buffer-one-frame-mode, OBOF) enabled could lead to the
    minor mode (OBOF) being turned off unexceptedly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>What's behind the change from Aquamacs Styles to Aquamacs
  Autofaces?</i> <span class="c2">Technical explanation: the core
  functionality of changing fonts and fore/background colors (in
  short: faces) is now provided by the new
  `aquamacs-autoface-mode'.</span></p>

  <p class="c3">How does the new <i>autoface</i> mode differ from
  the <i>styles</i> mode? Font and color settings now apply
  primarily to the default ``face'' used in the buffer. For each
  major mode, a new face is defined. For instance, the default face
  for LaTeX buffers is called `latex-mode-default'. These faces can
  be edited directly via the Options menu (to choose a font and
  some new entries to choose fore- and background colors) or even
  with M-x customize-face. These changes apply automatically and
  immediately to all buffers in the given major mode. In contrast,
  the <i>styles</i> mode used to set frame-wide parameters,
  including the font, fore- and background colors, and change these
  parameters in a frame according to the buffer shown in the first
  window within the frame. Frame parameters also included the
  presence of a toolbar, cursor color, fringes, and the like. These
  are not available in the new mode. Previously, colors of a whole
  plethora of faces for various occasions could be chosen via the
  `color-theme' package. These were needlessly tied to major modes
  using `aquamacs-styles'.</p>

  <p class="c3">One advantage of the new, lightweight
  implementation of `autofaces' is that switching between buffers
  (e.g., with tabs) is smooth and does not lead to ugly frame
  resizing effects. Multiple windows in the same frame can now
  display their buffers in the correct fonts.</p>

  <p class="c3">Transition: relevant mode-specific settings from
  `aquamacs-styles-mode' are automatically imported. The now
  deprecated functionality of `aquamacs-styles-mode' (changing
  frame parameters including the visibility of the toolbar) is
  still available to users by inserting</p>
  <pre>
(require 'aquamacs-styles)
(aquamacs-autoface-mode 0)
(aquamacs-styles-mode 1)
</pre><span class="c2">into their <tt>Preferences.el</tt> file.
Users can also access color themes with M-x color-theme-select, but
note that faces set using `aquamacs-autoface-mode' will override
foreground and background colors.</span>
