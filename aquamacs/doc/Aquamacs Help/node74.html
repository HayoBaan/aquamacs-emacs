14.31 Bug Fixes---0.9.5</A>
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Font ``Bitstream Vera Sans'' works again.  	

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Exiting view mode (e.g. help) with 'q' deletes the frame instead of
	iconifying it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The (Apple Help) manuals work now on systems where tcsh
	is the default shell.  (Reported by Arthur Ogus)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Startup with arguments -nw (tty / in terminal) revised.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>You can now redefine Aquamacs keys like this:

<P>
<TT>(define-key osx-key-mode-map [end] 'end-of-line)</TT>

<P>
(Thanks for reporting: Andreas Hess.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the user changes mac-command-modifier, it may be advisable to call

<P>
<TT>(osx-key-reset-mode-map)</TT>

<P>
This will ensure that the keymap is updated and Aquamacs installs
	its Mac-like keyboard commands (provided you want this).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>New frames will not open behind the Dock any more.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>An error message (harmless) when clicking on ;SPMquot;Finish;SPMquot; in customize is gone.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Error message during version check on startup removed (occurred in
	certain cases where users had upgraded their system.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In particular in TeX mode, Aquamacs tended to give audio signals all the
	time when there were internal exceptions (internal errors signaled) with parsing the TeX code. Therefore, we do not ring the bell any more,
	i.e. aquamacs-ring-bell-on-error-flag is nil by default.
	(Reported by Ken Bloom and Andreas Hess)
</LI>
<LI>Speedbar works when one-buffer-one-frame (``Open Buffers in Separate
	Frames'') is turned off. 
</LI>
<LI>Option-up/down (if Option is meta) now scrolls page-wise.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Other bug-fixes.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
