3.2 Configuring the Toolbars</A>
</H2>

<P>
The easiest way to set up icons in the toolbars is to right click on the toolbar that you'd like to customize and select <I>Customize Toolbar...</I>.  This will show a panel with all available icons.  Drag and drop those into the toolbar.

<P>
Note that if a mode provides its own set of icons or additional icons, Aquamacs will store a separate configuration for that toolbar.  This way, you can set up toolbars for different tasks.  (Note that if modes, perhaps after an upgrade, add or remove icons, Aquamacs will adopt a new customization set for the toolbar.)

<P>
Click on the button in the top right corner of the frame to remove the toolbar completely.  Use the menu items <I>Options / Appearance / Adopt Face and Frame Parameters as Default</I> and <I>Options / Save Options</I>  to make this change stick.

<P>
