  <ul>
    <li>SUMMARY: More bugs and other annoyances have been removed.
    Opening new frames (for new buffers) is more useful now, and
    frame themes aren't applied when a frame is split up. Options
    are automatically saved across sessions. A new customization
    groups for Emacs-die-hards makes it easier to change
    Aquamacs-specific customization defaults.</li>

    <li>Intel: Aquamacs is now available as native version for Mac
    computers with Intel CPU. Thanks to Jonathan Shea, Mike Bennett
    and Richard Koch for providing compile machines.</li>

    <li>Dired in one-buffer-one-frame-mode will show new
    directories and open files in the same frame.</li>

    <li>Customize will show new groups etc. in the same frame and
    window.</li>

    <li>One-Buffer-One-Frame-Mode ("Display Buffers in Separate
    Frames") will now show buffers such as *mail*, *grep*, *shell*
    in their own frames. This also applies if other modes open
    *...* buffers, such as ESS opening an inferior R shell, which
    previously didn't even show in a separate window.
    One-Buffer-One-Frame-Mode is also better documented now and has
    customization options so you can decide which buffers are shown
    in new frames.</li>

    <li>Frame-Appearance-Themes reconfigure a frame only if just
    one window is present (or all windows show buffers in the same
    major mode). This should more effectively prevent appearance
    switching when a second window is shown temporarily.</li>

    <li>Frame-Appearance-Themes now allow the user to delete all
    mode-specific themes when a default is defined. Hints to select
    "Save Options" are more prominent.</li>

    <li>Options are saved automatically upon quitting Aquamacs
    (it'll ask you.) - customize `aquamacs-save-options-on-quit' to
    configure.</li>

    <li>Quitting Aquamacs: you won't be asked any more whether to
    quit if modified buffers exist, because at that point you've
    always already been asked to save each modified buffer.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs-is-more-than-Emacs is a new customization group
    containing all customization variables whose defaults are
    changed in Aquamacs compared to GNU Emacs or the relevant
    package. This is useful for Emacs veterans who want certain
    behaviors to be more similar to GNU Emacs.</li>

    <li>Bug Reporting is handled fully in the system's default mail
    client again (unless you've set up a different
    `send-mail-function') Suggested by Robert Sloan</li>

    <li>Mail composed with the Message package will now be routed
    through the mail client by default
    (`message-send-mail-function') and there is no "From" line. If
    you run postfix locally, you may want to do something like the
    following in your .emacs or Preferences.el:
      <pre>
        (setq send-mail-function 'sendmail-send-it)
        (setq message-send-mail-function 'sendmail-send-it)
        (setq mail-setup-with-from t)
</pre>

      <p>Alternatively do the same in customization buffers.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Toolbar looks prettier now. Patch by Kim F. Storm</li>

    <li>`Frame-Appearance-Styles' is the new name for the former
    `Frame Appearance Themes, so they won't be confused with GNU
    Emacs new customization themes. A global minor mode called
    `aquamacs-styles-mode' is now used to switch them on/off.

      <p>Some configuration variables have been renamed:
      `aquamacs-default-styles' (was:
      `aquamacs-mode-specific-default-themes')
      `aquamacs-styles-mode' (was:
      `aquamacs-auto-frame-parameters-flag')
      `aquamacs-buffer-default-styles' (was:
      `aquamacs-buffer-specific-frame-themes')</p>
    </li>

    <li>A-Backspace deletes the whole logical line again, not just
    the visual line. A-Shift-Backspace deletes the visual line
    now.</li>

    <li>Tilde ~ can now be input on German keyboards with the
    German emulation mode via Option-N.</li>

    <li>Frame-positions for individual files are now saved
    to/loaded from a file called frame-positions.el
    (in&nbsp;/Library/Preferences...)</li>

    <li>Help buffers (C-h f, C-h v) for certain Aquamacs functions
    could have links to source code at nonexistant paths.</li>

    <li>site-start.el files in the load path (plug-ins!) aren't
    loaded any longer if there is a file named .ignore in the same
    path.</li>

    <li>Bugfix in version 0.9.9: customizations weren't read if
    aquamacs-styles (the former "Frame Appearance Themes" were
    switched off.) Reported by Brendan Dixon</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Typing C-x C-f, then A-w made the newly opened
    frame go away, but not the "Find file" prompt, which was quite
    persistent, especially if you didn't know about C-g and the
    minibuffer. That is fixed now. Reported by a number of
    people.</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Setting tool-bar-mode or changing the fringes via
    the Options menu will now affect the default frame style as
    well, so the setting will affect new frames (even if frame
    appearance styles are active). Note that if fringes or tool bar
    are set in .emacs, the customized and saved styles will
    override your settings.</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Aquamacs will not ask the user any longer whether
    to save dired buffers and other non-file-buffers upon deleting
    the frame (killing the buffer). Reported by Carsten
    Bormann</li>

    <li>Bugfix: desktop-mode should be able to restore the desktop
    on startup appropriately. Reported by Rudi Schlatte</li>

    <li>Bugfix: page-wise scrolling (PgUp/PgDown) with long lines
    scrolls exactly one screen now</li>

    <li>Bugfix: page-wise scrolling (PgUp/PgDown) will remove the
    region as expected when the cursor moves. Shift-PgUp/PgDown
    will extend the region (and set the mark if neccessary).</li>

    <li>Bugfix: completing-read-multiple didn't work (icomplete+
    library updated)</li>

    <li>Bugfix: frames sometimes didn't open in
    one-buffer-one-frame-mode when the buffer shown was empty.</li>

    <li>Bugfix: In one-buffer-one-frame-mode, Apple-W deletes a
    window or kills a buffer and returns to the next buffer in the
    buffer list (i.e. the previously shown buffer) when the frame
    wasn't created for the particular window / buffer being killed.
    Think of it as a stack of buffers that are shown. Previously,
    Aquamacs always switched to *scratch*.</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Preview &amp; Print now works with buffers in Tramp
    Mode, too. Reported by Tim Hodgson</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Fonts (not fontsets) set in default-frame-alist and
    similar variables are not filtered out any more after startup
    if they haven't been explicitly loaded (or applied to a frame,
    and thus, loaded). Reported by Konstantinos Efstathiou</li>

    <li>Bugfix: display copyright message at startup.</li>

    <li>Bugfix: Javascript-mode exchanged for the one borrowed from
    XEmacs. This one will hopefully work better now. Suggested by
    Tom Van Vleck</li>

    <li>Bugfix: ediff-directories interferes less with
    one-buffer-one-frame-mode.</li>

    <li>Compiling: Those who build Aquamacs themselves, note that
    the make-aquamacs script will now produce a complete app bundle
    located in (emacs-path)/mac/Aquamacs. The install-aquamacs
    script only moves the bundle to /Applications. If you make any
    changes to the Aquamacs source code (except for pre-loaded code
    in site-load.el), it is usually sufficient to run "copy-to-app
    -n". Remember to set the AQUAMACS_ROOT and EMACS_ROOT
    environment variables before using any of these scripts.</li>

    <li>A BIG THANKYOU goes to all users who have donated
    (<tt><a name="tex2html58" href="http://aquamacs.org/donate" id=
    "tex2html58">http://aquamacs.org/donate</a></tt>) in the past
    months. I'd also like to thank all those who tested the beta
    versions, reported bugs and contributed ideas and server space:
    Nathaniel Cunningham, Peter Dyballa, Terry Jones,
    Jos&Atilde;&copy; Figuera O'Farrill, Konrad Podczeck, Robert
    Sloan and many others.</li>
