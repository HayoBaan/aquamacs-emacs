2.1 What Makes Aquamacs Like Other Text Editors</A>
</H2> 
When you first launch Aquamacs, you will see that it is like many other text editors: you can type text, cut and paste text, and save and close a file using the menubar or standard OS X keyboard shortcuts (Command-S for save, Command-X for cut, Command-V for paste, and so on). If you are writing one of the many text formats that is supported by Aquamacs, such as HTML, you will also note Aquamacs' use of <I>syntax coloring,</I> which sets certain parts of the text---such as HTML markup---in a different color than the text content. This makes editing the text and adjusting the markup easier.

<P>
If you are used to the way Emacs does things, you may be surprised about how Aquamacs works:  Aquamacs differs significantly from Emacs.  While the useful Emacs key bindings are supported and Emacs packages usually just work, Aquamacs is adapted to be comparable to younger text editors (than Emacs).  It also comes with a range of packages that give you greater comfort in editing certain types of files.
