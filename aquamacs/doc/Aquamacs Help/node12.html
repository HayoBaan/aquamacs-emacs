3.5 Options</A>
</H2>
The Options menu is where you can easily customize your
settings. The options that you can configure include syntax coloring,
matching of parentheses (useful for text markup that depends on open
and close brackets), how to display buffers and frames, fonts, and other
settings. For more information on fonts, please see Section <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#Look#69><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
If you want to delve deeply into customizing Aquamacs, select
``Customize Emacs:Top-Level Customization Group'' in the Options
menu. A new frame titled ``Customize Group: Emacs'' will open. Scroll
down and find the ``Aquamacs Group'' listing, and push the ``Go to
Group'' button. This will open a new frame with all of the
configuration options for Aquamacs ---power users can customize Aquamacs this way, or via the Emacs Lisp programming language, elisp---and each option is documented there. 
Table <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#tab:variables#70><tex2html_cr_mark></A> displays a complete list of the options.
