<h3 class="section">37.15 Window Dividers</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-dividers-4309"></a><a name="index-right-dividers-4310"></a><a name="index-bottom-dividers-4311"></a>
Window dividers are bars drawn between a frame's windows.  A right
divider is drawn between a window and any adjacent windows on the right. 
Its width (thickness) is specified by the frame parameter
<code>right-divider-width</code>.  A bottom divider is drawn between a
window and adjacent windows on the bottom or the echo area.  Its width
is specified by the frame parameter <code>bottom-divider-width</code>.  In
either case, specifying a width of zero means to not draw such dividers. 
See <a href="Layout-Parameters.html#Layout-Parameters">Layout Parameters</a>.

   <p>Technically, a right divider belongs to the window on its left,
which means that its width contributes to the total width of that
window.  A bottom divider belongs to the window above it, which
means that its width contributes to the total height of that window. 
See <a href="Window-Sizes.html#Window-Sizes">Window Sizes</a>.  When a window has both, a right and a bottom
divider, the bottom divider prevails.  This means that a bottom
divider is drawn over the full total width of its window while the right
divider ends above the bottom divider.

   <p>Dividers can be dragged with the mouse and are therefore useful for
adjusting the sizes of adjacent windows with the mouse.  They also serve
to visually set apart adjacent windows when no scroll bars or mode lines
are present.  The following three faces allow to customize the
appearance of dividers:

     <dl>
<dt><code>window-divider</code><dd>When a divider is less than three pixels wide, it is drawn solidly with
the foreground of this face.  For larger dividers this face is used for
the inner part only, excluding the first and last pixel.

     <br><dt><code>window-divider-first-pixel</code><dd>This is the face used for drawing the first pixel of a divider that is
at least three pixels wide.  To obtain a solid appearance, set this to
the same value used for the <code>window-divider</code> face.

     <br><dt><code>window-divider-last-pixel</code><dd>This is the face used for drawing the last pixel of a divider that is at
least three pixels wide.  To obtain a solid appearance, set this to the
same value used for the <code>window-divider</code> face. 
</dl>

   <p>You can get the sizes of the dividers of a specific window with the
following two functions.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-right-divider-width</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dright_002ddivider_002dwidth-4312"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the width (thickness) in pixels of <var>window</var>'s right divider. 
<var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one. 
The return value is always zero for a rightmost window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-bottom-divider-width</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dbottom_002ddivider_002dwidth-4313"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the width (thickness) in pixels of <var>window</var>'s bottom divider. 
<var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one. 
The return value is zero for the minibuffer window or a bottommost
window on a minibuffer-less frame. 
</p></blockquote></div>
