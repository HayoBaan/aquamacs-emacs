3.5.4 The Right Look: Colors and Fonts for Frames and Modes
</H3>
Aquamacs allows you to alter specific features of the current frame
via functions in the Options menu. ``Font for *-mode...'' lets you
choose from the installed system fonts.  You can also choose foreground and background colors.  <I> These settings only apply to buffers in the current major mode</I>, provided <I>Autofaces</I> is turned on (as is by default).  Without Autofaces, the settings apply to all frames and set the frame default.  

<P>
With <I>Autofaces</I>, Aquamacs Emacs lets you pick a style specific to the current
mode.  For example, you can use different font settings when you are editing
C or LaTeX, then when you are editing a text file.   Note that all settings not sepcified for the mode are taken over from the default. Specifically, color and font choices are prioritized in this order: <#105#><I>1.</I><#105#> Mode-specific face, <#106#><I>2.</I><#106#> Autoface Default Face, <#107#><I>3.</I><#107#> Frame default.

<P>
You can use ``Adopt Frame Parameters as Frame Default'' to accept the appearance of the current frame for future frames; this includes the visibility of the tool bar, fringes, and more (but not position and size).

<P>
If you're more of an Emacs expert and you'd like to configure things manually by means of elisp or the customization buffer, configure the following faces. With Autofaces, you can customize the faces directly (via M-x customize-face).  The face name for a major mode is always named after the major mode, e.g. ``latex-mode-default'' is the autoface face for `latex-mode'.  The Autoface default face is named `autoface-default'. 
The default for all frames is the `default' face.

<P>
You can also customize the variables for the frame default: ``default-frame-alist'' and ``initial-frame-alist'', as documented in the Emacs manual.  You can, alternatively, use ``Adopt Frame Parameters as Frame Default'' to accept the appearance of the current frame for future frames; this includes the visibility of the tool bar.

<P>
