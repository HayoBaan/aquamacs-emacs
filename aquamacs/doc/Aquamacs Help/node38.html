<P>
If you'd like to join us in working on Aquamacs, download the source
code from Git and take a look. Do ask if you have questions! When you
have a patch or a less specific suggestion for improvements, send it
to the development mailing list.

<P>
We're a very open team. Everyone is allowed to suggest modifications
to every piece of code. There is no ``ownership'' of code, so please
join us to make Aquamacs even better!
