3.6 Window</A>
</H2>
The Window menu allows you to navigate through the windows and frames that you may have open. Note that a ``buffer'' is not synonymous with a window or frame, in that you can split a frame and have more than one buffer contained within. (Multiple windows/frames is a feature of Aquamacs; standard Emacs does not support this.) In addition to standard frames that display open files, there are a few other important buffer types. One is the ``scratch'' buffer, which is simply a buffer to type notes into; this can also be the starting point for a file to save, and a buffer to type configuration commands for Aquamacs (an advanced feature). Another is the ``Messages'' buffer, which displays a log of output from Emacs commands and operations. Finally, there is the ``info'' buffer, in which Aquamacs Emacs displays built-in user help, tutorials and other documentation in Emacs' ``info'' format.

<P>
From the Window menu, you can also open a new ``frame,'', or split the open window into two separate ones.  There are keyboard shortcuts for all of these commands.
