  <ul>
    <li>Based on GNU Emacs 22.1.</li>

    <li>Java support has just gotten a lot better. JDEE is a
    complete, integrated development environment for Java in Emacs.
    It supports building, source-level debugging, code generation
    and much more. Aquamacs now contains the latest version of
    JDEE, configured to work with the Java SDK installed via
    Apple's Developer Tools. Visit <tt><a name="tex2html66" href=
    "http://jdee.sunsite.dk" id=
    "tex2html66">http://jdee.sunsite.dk</a></tt> for more
    information.</li>

    <li>Toolbar: The icons have been completely redesigned. The
    colors make them easy to distinguish. The functions available
    from the standard toolbar have been carefully selected. Using
    the Options - Show/Hide - Toolbar items menu, icons may be
    shown or hidden to fit the user's needs.

      <p>Available functions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>New, open, save/save as, revert buffer</li>

        <li>Undo, redo</li>

        <li>Cut/copy/paste</li>

        <li>Find (isearch)</li>

        <li>Spell-check buffer (ispell-buffer)</li>

        <li>Print</li>

        <li>Make a new frame</li>

        <li>Preferences</li>

        <li>Help</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We'd like to acknowledge the artists:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Preferences, Revert Buffer, Kill Buffer: Jasper
        Hauser</li>

        <li>New Frame, Recent Files, Spell-check: Nuovext
        Project</li>

        <li>all other icons: Adrian Chromenko and David
        Reitter</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Spell-Checking can now be found in the Edit menu, not in
    Tools. The "Check As You Type" function (flyspell-mode) will
    automatically check the buffer contents (unless it's a big
    buffer) when first enabled.</li>

    <li>Spell-Checking now supports the popular cocoAspell package,
    which includes English language dictionaries and the GNU Aspell
    spell-checking library. Additional dictionaries may be
    installed.</li>

    <li>Formatting (filling) text with M-q (Option-q) is a bit more
    convenient now: when a region is selected, the command applies
    to the whole region and not just to a paragraph. We also
    provide M-Q (Option-Shift-q) to "unfill" a paragraph or a
    region, which comes in handy when wrapped text needs to be
    converted to soft-wrapped text, or to copy&amp;paste it into
    other applications.</li>

    <li>one-buffer-one-frame-mode is more compatible to the normal
    Emacs paradigm of one-frame-many-buffers for internal technical
    reasons, but also with respect to whether newly opened frames
    (windows) are actually selected and receive the following user
    inputs. In many situations, classical Emacs shows a buffer in
    an extra window, but doesn't select it - so the user can keep
    working on the original document. Aquamacs will now do the same
    - it will raise the appropriate frame, but not select it. If
    you would like to make it select at all newly opened frames,
    use this in your Preferences.el:

      <p>(setq display-buffer-reuse-frames 'select)</p>

      <p>Also (the technical change): Function `switch-to-buffer'
      will set the current buffer immediately without waiting for
      the next top-level event loop.) Thanks to Lowell Vaughn for
      pointing out a seemingly unimportant bug in one of Emacs'
      on-board games, which led to the discovery of this issue.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Undo as in the original Emacs is available again via
    `undo'. Apple-Z and Apple-Shift-Z are bound to Aquamacs
    undo/redo functions (now called `aquamacs-undo/redo' as they
    used to be, but seasoned Emacs users may now use
    Control-underscore to access the classical undo. The difference
    is that the old-school undo will undo it's own undo steps.
    Suggested by Rudi Schlatte</li>

    <li>Undo (aquamacs-undo, Apple-Z) will now restore point and
    mark as appropriate.</li>

    <li>Left/Right keys will now behave more Mac-like, whenever
    text is marked (i.e. the mark is active / text has been
    selected). They now move to the beginning or the end of that
    region, respectively. To turn off this behavior, turn off CUA
    mode or rebind left/right keys in osx-key-low-priority-key-map
    by adding this to your Preferences.el or .emacs file: ]
    (define-key osx-key-low-priority-key-map [left] 'backward-char)

      <p>(define-key osx-key-low-priority-key-map [right]
      'forward-char)</p>

      <p>(osx-key-mode 1)</p>
    </li>

    <li>Apple-2 can now be used to split the window into two (like
    C-x 2), Apple-1 will undo that split (like C-x 1).</li>

    <li>Cut/Copy/Paste with the secondary selection (use Option +
    mouse) are now bound to Option-Apple-X, Option-Apple-C,
    respectively (unless Option is not Meta, in which case you'd
    use ESC Apple C, or whatever M-A-c is for you.) (This is to
    avoid problems in cases when Caps Lock is on, which is
    recognized as Shift modifier.)</li>

    <li>The current major mode may be changed in the context
    menu</li>

    <li>Emulate-Mac-German|Italian|...-Keyboard-Modes now allow you
    to call the commands bound to the original Meta key
    combinations using the "Esc" key. For example, in the German
    keyboard emulation, pressing Option-l will give you @, while
    Esc l will do `downcase-word'. Also, this mode now supports
    searching (Apple-F) with `isearch'. Reported by Thomas
    K&Atilde;&curren;ufl. Additionally, an emulation mode for the
    Finnish keyboard layout is available now. Patch by Lauri
    Raittila.</li>

    <li>Default colors in help and *Messages* frames/buffers
    revised. Suggested by Charles Bailey</li>

    <li>Recently opened files that were opened from the "Recent
    Files" menu, or from an external shell with the 'open' command
    or something similar are now available in the minibuffer
    history that one gets with C-x C-f `up'.</li>

    <li>Clicking into raised frames (windows) that are not the
    selected frame (i.e. have grey instead of red-yellow-green
    buttons) will now activate that frame. Patch by Yamamoto
    Mitsuharu</li>

    <li>Creator codes for loaded files are maintained and not
    always reset to the Aquamacs / Emacs code. This way, users may
    use the Finder to open specific files with another application
    by default, but still edit the file in Aquamacs.</li>

    <li>Updated AUCTeX (11.84). [M-x latex-mode]. XeTeX users:
    please customize `TeX-command-list' to call XeTeX
    directly.</li>

    <li>Haskell mode included (2.3). [M-x haskell-mode]</li>

    <li>RubyOnRails support via emacs-rails included (0.5.3) [M-x
    rails-minor-mode, with M-x ruby-mode]</li>

    <li>ACT-R support. [M-x actr-mode]</li>

    <li>Menu Bar fixes. (Disabled menu bar entries when frames
    invisible.)</li>

    <li>Aquamacs menu name shortened. Suggested by Enrico
    Franconi</li>

    <li>Accessibility in OS X fixes (simulated clicks on Window
    elements) Suggested by Alexis Gallagher Patch by Yamamoto
    Mitsuharu</li>

    <li>HTML files (and others) can be opened in the system's
    default browser again. This applies to C-c C-z v in
    html-helper-mode and other modes using `browse-url'.</li>

    <li>Tramp files (i.e. remote files loaded with
    /uid@host:/path/to/file syntax) are noted in the "recent files"
    history list and not discarded any longer when Aquamacs is
    restarted.</li>

    <li>1.0a: Some documentation of Emacs functions (C-h f setq
    RET, e.g.) was not available on PPC Macs. Reported by David
    Sagan and Bill Rising.</li>

    <li>1.0a: Some additional executables like movemail did not
    work on PPC Macs. Reported by Barbara Shirtcliff.</li>

    <li>1.0b: Ruby-mode included in new-buffer/change major mode
    menu</li>

    <li>1.0b: The underlying source code is now fixed to be GNU
    Emacs 22.1 plus Aquamacs extensions.</li>

    <li>1.0b: On older PPC Macs, text input was only updated slowly
    whenever the tool bar (icons at the top of the frame) was
    turned on.</li>

    <li>1.0b: Gnus did not work correctly. Reported by Martin
    J&Atilde;&cedil; rgensen.</li>

    <li>1.0b: M-x tile-frames-horizontally/vertically fixed. Patch
    by Ben Hyde. Updated to new `oneonone' library version, code by
    Drew Adams.</li>

    <li>1.0b: Moving the point left or right with the arrow keys
    could cause an error message ``Mark inactive'' to appear in
    certain circumstances. Reported by Michel Charpentier.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thanks for supplying build machines: Toby Blake (U Edinburgh),
  James Pringle (U New Hampshire) and Carlo Gandolfi (Milan).</p>
