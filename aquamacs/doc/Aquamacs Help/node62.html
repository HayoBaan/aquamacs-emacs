  <ul>
    <li><b>Aquamacs has tabs</b>. Press Apple-T to create one. You
    can switch the general use of tabs on in the Options menu.
    (Note that while the `tabbar' package is provided and used
    internally, the actual functionality is different.) Concept and
    Code by Nathaniel Cunningham, David&nbsp;Ponce and David
    Reitter.</li>

    <li><b>``Frame Styles'' are turned off</b> by default now. This
    means that there are no major mode specific settings (fonts,
    colors) unless the styles are turned back on (Options menu).
    There is a new ``Clear All Styles'' menu item, and the wording
    has been improved. There should be less flicker when switching
    buffers. The frame size and position are not changed, even if
    the frame leaves the screen.</li>

    <li><b>Revised word wrapping</b>: Soft and hard wrapping can
    now be recognized automatically (Options / Auto Word Wrap for
    Text Modes). Also, Soft and Hard wrap modes are now enabled
    just for the current buffer. (The former option to
    automatically enable this is still available via customization
    of the `text-mode-hook' setting.)</li>

    <li><b>Full screen editing</b>: Press Apple-Shift-Return to get
    into full screen mode. (There are some known problems with this
    in conjunction with changing the frame's fonts. These will be
    addressed in the future.) Code by Joel Stanley and David
    Reitter.</li>

    <li><b>Aquamacs does not create backup files (foo.bar&nbsp;)
    any longer</b> by default. This way, no unnecessary files won't
    get in your way any longer. (No Mac application creates these.
    Use Time Machine or a dedicated backup solution for backup
    needs.) There is an Option in the ``Options'' menu which will
    turn backups on again.</li>

    <li><b>The *scratch* buffer is now persistent</b> across
    sessions. It is saved to an internal file, but File / Save As
    (or Apple-Shift-S or C-x C-w) still allow users to save the
    file elsewhere. (To switch this off, customize the
    `aquamacs-scratch-file' variable to nil.)</li>

    <li>The position (and height and width) of the (main) frame is
    now persistent across sessions. (Customize
    `initial-frame-alist' as documented to open the first frame
    somewhere else.) `default-frame-alist' settings for the frame
    position and extent of subsequent frames are now respected by
    default. Aquamacs will not, however, open frames off the
    screen.</li>

    <li>The tool bar looks like other toolbars on OS X now. Code by
    Yamamoto Mitsuharu.</li>

    <li>We've got better-looking icons (``alpha channel'') for the
    tool bar, and labels under the icons like in other OS X
    programs. (You can save the space for that by customizing
    `mac-tool-bar-display-mode' to `icons'.)</li>

    <li>Toolbar items of other modes (such as for LaTeX editing)
    can be configured via Options / Show/Hide / Toolbar items.</li>

    <li>Multi-lingual CocoAspell support: installed dictionaries
    can now be changed from within Aquamacs. Code by Nathaniel
    Cunningham</li>

    <li>``Check Spelling as You Type" can now be set as the default
    for all text modes, in the Edit / Spelling menu.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs generally will not show graphical dialog boxes for
    confirmation questions (unless the mouse has been used last)
    any longer. This ensures greater consistency on multi-screen
    setups and when the frame was off the visible area of the
    screen.</li>

    <li>Before any minibuffer interaction takes place, Aquamacs
    will attempt to ensure that the minibuffer is actually visible:
    this may involve moving frames into a visible area of the
    screen. (To turn this behavior off, try M-x
    smart-frame-positioning-mode RET, or customize the variable of
    the same name.)</li>

    <li>Aquamacs now knows more about multi-screen setups (when it
    comes to frame positioning).</li>

    <li>Preferences and other code defined in Preferences.el now
    override any customizations: the customization file
    (`custom-file', i.e. customizations.el) is now loaded before
    the Emacs Lisp code in Preferences.el. This may have
    consequences for individual configurations, but it ultimately
    allows users to override any semi-automatic customizations in
    their Emacs Lisp code. (Note that&nbsp;/.emacs is still loaded
    before the customization file in order to maintain
    compatibility with GNU Emacs.)</li>

    <li>
      <b>Improved LaTeX support</b>: AUCTeX 11.85 included. This
      brings a number of advantages for LaTeX users, in particular:

      <ul>
        <li>Better analysis of errors reported by the LaTeX
        compiler.</li>

        <li>Improved syntax highlighting when editing .tex
        documents.</li>
      </ul>Code by Ralf Angeli, David Kastrup and others.
    </li>

    <li>Searching with Apple-F and Apple-G (isearch) is now more
    comfortable: it will not normally extend a region (unless
    started with C-Space). Apple-G (repeat the search) will always
    set the mark to the beginning of the match so that the region
    captures the match. This allows users to replace the text of
    the match with something else easily.</li>

    <li>When the mark is set with C-Space, it is more persistent
    than before: clicking somewhere will not disable it, but extend
    the region, just like moving the point with arrow keys (and
    other movement keys) would do.</li>

    <li>LaTeX mode comes with more appropriate icons now.</li>

    <li>Color Themes updated to version 6.6.0. Code by Xavier
    Maillard and Jonadab the Unsightly One.</li>

    <li>The ``Buffers'' menu can now be found on the right hand
    side of the menu bar. It is called ``Window''.</li>

    <li>The mode line (at the bottom of each frame) now uses the
    system's standard font.</li>

    <li>Control-left and Control-right will now move to the
    beginning or end of the line, respectively, as is standard in
    OS X. Similarly, Meta-left and Meta-right will now move forward
    or back by single words (this is usually Option-left or
    Option-right). (`forward-' and `backward-sexp-nomark' can now
    be invoked via C-M-right or -left.) Suggested by
    Jean-Christophe Helary.</li>

    <li>Apple-[ and Apple-] switch between Emacs windows (i.e.,
    within a frame). Suggested by Jean-Christophe Helary.</li>

    <li>C-backspace deletes a whole file name (i.e., one part of a
    path) instead of just a word in the minibuffer when a file is
    selected. M-backspace (usually Option-backspace) deletes the
    portion of the word to the left, as is standard, while M-delete
    (usually Option-delete) the one to the right. If a region is
    marked, that is deleted.</li>

    <li>M-e (forward-sentence) and M-a (backward-sentence) do the
    right thing now even if the text does not have two spaces after
    each sentence. (New customization variable
    `sentence-end-double-space-for-recognition'.)</li>

    <li>Apple-F and Apple-G (search, repeat the search) will now
    mark the found text as region as is standard.</li>

    <li>Apple-V can now me used immediately after entering isearch
    (Apple-F) in order to look for the text stored in the
    pasteboard. Suggested by Nathaniel Cunningham.</li>

    <li>Apple-2 (split window) will now select the newly created
    window.</li>

    <li>Improved usability in the Options menu: Wrap options greyed
    out when not in a text mode, and no more ``save places''
    option.</li>

    <li>There's a new ``Check for Updates'' menu item in the
    Aquamacs menu. If a new version is available, it can be
    downloaded using a key binding (C-h u).</li>

    <li>Undo/Redo toolbar and menu items are disabled/enabled at
    the right times (i.e., when there is something to
    undo/redo).</li>

    <li>``Search'' toolbar item is not shown by default.
    ``History'' and ``Redo'' items are shown by default. (Use the
    Options / Show/Hide / Toolbar menu to configure.)</li>

    <li>The context menu now allows to ``search on this Mac'' with
    Spotlight (on OS X 10.4 or newer).</li>

    <li>Font settings for a frame do not affect the mode-line any
    longer. You can M-x customize-face mode-line, specifying a
    standard OS X font as ``Font family'' (such as Monaco).</li>

    <li>Files are loaded (visited) a little faster now.
    `default-major-mode' now defaults to `fundamental-mode' rather
    than `text-mode', which should have no practical consequences
    apart from the speed-up.</li>

    <li>Worked around a bug in OS X that caused occasional, very
    slow program start on some systems.</li>

    <li>User-supplied settings of `fill-column' should now be
    respected (used for hard word wrapping as enabled in the
    Options menu). Reported by Ivan Werning.</li>

    <li>Some commands (such as M-x shell) will use the current
    window rather than showing a new one, unless
    `one-buffer-one-frame-mode' (Options / Show Buffers in New
    Frames) is enabled. Suggested by Jean-Christophe Helary.</li>
