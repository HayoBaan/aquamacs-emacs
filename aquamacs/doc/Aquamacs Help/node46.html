14.3 Changes--- 3.1a</A>
</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Command-Shift-Left/Right now select the text from point to the left or right side of the line, as they did in Aquamacs 2. 
Reported by Daniel Stegm&#252;ller.
</LI>
<LI>The order of menu items in the Options/Line Wrapping submenu has been restored.
Reported by Gracjan Polak.
</LI>
<LI>Isearch using the Mac key bindings (A-f, A-g) has seen some improvements.  A-g will now highlight all other search results (just like regular isearch), and it will continue a regexp isearch (started with C-u A-f).  Because you remain in `isearch-mode' after a A-g, additional simple keys will just extend the search string.  (You may, as before, do other things like insert text clippings with A-v.)
</LI>
<LI>During Isearch started with A-f or A-g, you may now use the Enter (RET) key to advance to the next location, and S-RET to go back to the previous one (same bindings as A-g and A-S-g).  This is in accordance with search functions in other Mac applications.  Traditional Emacs behavior of isearch when started with C-s is not affected.
Suggested by Jeremy Cole.
</LI>
<LI>Cursor motion with arrow keys will follow the
visual order of characters on the screen: <I>left</I> always moves to the
left, <I>right</I> always moves to the right, disregarding the surrounding
bidirectional context.  You may change this setting with the customization variable `visual-order-cursor-movement'.
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs is now based on Emacs 24.4.  Please see etc/NEWS for detailed information.  Some more important, user-visible changes are:

<UL>
<LI>Frames and windows now resize smoothly, pixel by pixel.
</LI>
<LI>In keymaps where SPC scrolls forward, S-SPC now scrolls backward.
This affects View mode, etc.
</LI>
<LI>The cursor stops blinking after 10 blinks (by default) on X and Nextstep.
You can change the default by customizing `blink-cursor-blinks'.
</LI>
<LI>`electric-indent-mode' is now enabled by default.
Typing RET reindents the current line and indents the new line.
C-j inserts a newline but does not indent.  In some programming modes,
additional characters are electric (eg `{').
</LI>
<LI>The behavior of C-x TAB (`indent-rigidly') has changed.
When invoked without a prefix argument, it now activates a transient
mode in which typing left, right, S-left, and S-right adjusts
the text indentation in the region.  Typing any other key resumes
normal editing behavior.
</LI>
<LI>New command C-x SPC (`rectangle-mark-mode') makes a rectangular region.
Most commands are still unaware of it, but kill/yank do work on the rectangle.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Package-specific information is now stored in <#1186#>&#126;<#903#><#903#><#1186#>/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Packages.  Files are automatically moved to the new location so that correctly implemented packages should not be affected.  (Switching to a previous Aquamacs version, however, will cause some settings to be lost.)
</LI>
<LI>Tramp reliability improved.
Reported by Steve Bellan. 
</LI>
<LI>`ams-tex-mode' is functional again.
Reported by Albert Fisher. 
</LI>
<LI>Switching buffers when tabbar-mode (``Show Tabs'') is off and one-buffer-one-frame-mode (``Show Buffers in New Frames'') no longer produces an error message in certain situations. 
Reported by Bob Berwick.
</LI>
<LI>Dragging and dropping colors from the color selection panel now works more reliably.
Reported by Konrad Podczeck.
</LI>
<LI>ESS mode was updated to version 14.09. See here for new features: <TT><A NAME="tex2html34"
  HREF="http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html#New-features">http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html#New-features</A></TT>
</LI>
<LI>Markdown-mode 2.0 is now provided with a default configuration of its faces, which no longer hides markup.
</LI>
<LI>Version 3.1a only: an incompatibility with older OS X versions (pre-10.9) and the use of secondary displays was resolved.
Reported by Erik Marklund.
</LI>
<LI>Version 3.1a only: a warning indicating a failure to create a file in the Library folder (in new installations) has been resolved.
Reported by `xenzo' and Torsten M&#228;hne.
</LI>
</UL>
