<LI>Aquamacs failed to start up correctly on some systems with a
  Japanese (or other) locale.
Reported by Carson Reynolds.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Printing through htmlize now has a monochrome option that
  removes all face foreground and background colors and simply prints
  black on white.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple-<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1199# and Apple-<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline1201# now raise the next or previous frame (respectively).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To bring up the *Messages* buffer, a double click into the echo
  area is now needed instead of a single click.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs now includes the Emacs Lisp Reference as convenient
  Apple Help document, available from the Help menu (``More Manuals'').

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Files created with Aquamacs can now have their default associations changed in Finder more reliable. Aquamacs now sets the file type of newly created files to TEXT. Icons associated with such files should now bear the Aquamacs logo.
Reported by Frank J.R. Hanstick.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Ediff does not bring up errors any longer when called repeatedly.
Reported by various users.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In LaTeX-mode, references such as 
<BR>cite{...} are not
  highlighted any longer when hovering with the mouse over them. This
  was confusing. Use `bib-highlight-mouse-t' to turn it back on.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Ruby on Rails mode updated to emacs-rails 0.5.99.5. This  fixes
  a the startup problem (missing ``snippet'') with rails.
  Reported by Marc Siegel.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Emacs Speaks Statistic (ESS, R-mode etc.) updated to version 5.3.6.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fitting frame sizes to the content displayed with M-x fit-frame
  works now, because `inhibit-fit-frame' is nil by default. Frames
  will still be at least 68 characters wide (`create-frame-min-width')
  to ensure that *Help* frames are wide enough (if Frame Appearance
  Styles are active, as by default).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The menu entry `Paste' works for material copied from other
  applications now just like Apple-V always did. 
Reported by Matthew Hoyles.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs has always imported the environment from the login
  shell, e.g. any environment variable you might have set in your
  /.bash_profile. The elements of a PATH known to the login shell now
  take priority over elements in the PATH defined by the system. That
  means that if newer versions of system-supplied utilities are
  installed with Fink or Darwinports, these will be used from within
  Aquamacs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs should run even without the font Monaco available on the system.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The location of the Abbreviations file was changed. If you have any personal customizations there, move them:

<P>
mv ~/.abbrev_defs ``<#1193#>&#126;<#1092#><#1092#><#1193#>/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Abbreviations''

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Revised message in echo area upon startup.
Suggested by Richard Stallman.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Based on the latest GNU Emacs 22 code, including improvements to
  the 22.1 release.

<P>
