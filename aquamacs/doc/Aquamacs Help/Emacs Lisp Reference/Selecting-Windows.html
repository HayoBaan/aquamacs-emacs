<p><a name="index-selecting-a-window-2502"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>select-window</b><var> window &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-select_002dwindow-2503"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the selected window and the window
selected within its frame (see <a href="Basic-Windows.html#Basic-Windows">Basic Windows</a>) and selects that
frame.  It also makes <var>window</var>'s buffer (see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>) current and sets that buffer's value of <code>point</code> to the
value of <code>window-point</code> (see <a href="Window-Point.html#Window-Point">Window Point</a>) in <var>window</var>. 
<var>window</var> must be a live window.  The return value is <var>window</var>.

        <p>By default, this function also moves <var>window</var>'s buffer to the front
of the buffer list (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>), and makes <var>window</var> the
most recently selected window.  However, if the optional argument
<var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, these additional actions are omitted.

        <p>This function runs <code>buffer-list-update-hook</code> (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>)
unless <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>.  Note that applications and
internal routines often temporarily select a window in order to simplify
coding.  As a rule, such selections (including those made by the macros
<code>save-selected-window</code> and <code>with-selected-window</code> below) are
not recorded thus avoiding to pollute <code>buffer-list-update-hook</code>. 
Selections that really count are those causing a visible change in
the next redisplay of <var>window</var>'s frame and should be always
recorded.  This also means that to run a function each time a window
gets selected, putting it on <code>buffer-list-update-hook</code> should be
the right choice. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-most-recently-selected-windows-2504"></a>  The sequence of calls to <code>select-window</code> with a non-<code>nil</code>
<var>norecord</var> argument determines an ordering of windows by their
selection time.  The function <code>get-lru-window</code> can be used to
retrieve the least recently selected live window (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html#Cyclic-Window-Ordering">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>save-selected-window</b><var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-save_002dselected_002dwindow-2505"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro records the selected frame, as well as the selected window
of each frame, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then restores the
earlier selected frame and windows.  It also saves and restores the
current buffer.  It returns the value of the last form in <var>forms</var>.

        <p>This macro does not save or restore anything about the sizes,
arrangement or contents of windows; therefore, if <var>forms</var> change
them, the change persists.  If the previously selected window of some
frame is no longer live at the time of exit from <var>forms</var>, that
frame's selected window is left alone.  If the previously selected
window is no longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of
<var>forms</var> remains selected.  The current buffer is restored if and
only if it is still live when exiting <var>forms</var>.

        <p>This macro changes neither the ordering of recently selected windows nor
the buffer list. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>with-selected-window</b><var> window forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002dselected_002dwindow-2506"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro selects <var>window</var>, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then
restores the previously selected window and current buffer.  The ordering
of recently selected windows and the buffer list remain unchanged unless
you deliberately change them within <var>forms</var>; for example, by calling
<code>select-window</code> with argument <var>norecord</var> <code>nil</code>.

        <p>This macro does not change the order of recently selected windows or
the buffer list. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>frame-selected-window</b><var> &amp;optional frame<a name="index-frame_002dselected_002dwindow-2507"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the window on <var>frame</var> that is selected
within that frame.  <var>frame</var> should be a live frame; if omitted or
<code>nil</code>, it defaults to the selected frame. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-frame-selected-window</b><var> frame window &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-set_002dframe_002dselected_002dwindow-2508"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the window selected within the frame
<var>frame</var>.  <var>frame</var> should be a live frame; if <code>nil</code>, it
defaults to the selected frame.  <var>window</var> should be a live window;
if <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the selected window.

        <p>If <var>frame</var> is the selected frame, this makes <var>window</var> the
selected window.

        <p>If the optional argument <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this
function does not alter the list of most recently selected windows,
nor the buffer list.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-use-time</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002duse_002dtime-2512"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This functions returns the use time of window <var>window</var>. 
<var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one. 
The <dfn>use time</dfn> of a window is not really a time value, but it does
increase monotonically with each window selection, so the window with
the lowest use time is the least recently selected one, and the
window with the highest use time is the most recently selected
one.
