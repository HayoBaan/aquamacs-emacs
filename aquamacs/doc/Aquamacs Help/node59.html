  <ul>
    <li>Aquamacs now makes it easier for users to copy, cut and
    paste (and kill and yank) whole words, phrases or sentences by
    managing the spaces between words for them. Spaces are removed
    and automatically inserted where needed, whenever the new
    `smart-spacing-mode' is turned on. The Options menu provides a
    setting to turn it on automatically for all <em>text-mode</em>
    and related buffers. To set a default for all buffers,
    configure the option `global-smart-spacing-mode' using the
    customization interface.</li>

    <li>A problem that caused error messages upon startup and,
    sometimes, a failure to quit for some users (and only if
    Aquamacs was installed for the first time) was fixed. Reported
    by William Triplett, Kevin Brubeck Unhammer and Jean-Christophe
    Helary.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs now quits faster in some situations.</li>

    <li>JDEE, the Java Development Environment for Emacs is no
    longer included in Aquamacs but provided as a point-and-click
    installer plugin, which can be downloaded from the Aquamacs
    website. This reduces the size of the Aquamacs distribution,
    while maintaining an easy way for Java programmers to install
    the package. Note that JDEE also includes CEDET.</li>

    <li>Tabs showing a buffer that is mirrored in other windows
    will retain their position of point.</li>

    <li>With soft wrapping on (Options menu), M-q now calls
    `unfill-paragraph-or-region', which has the same semantics as
    `fill-paragraph-or-region' for hard wrapped text.</li>

    <li>C-z is no longer bound to minimize the frame. Users who
    require this feature can add the key binding in their
    <tt>Preferences.el</tt> file: <tt>(define-key osx-key-mode-map
    `[(control z)] 'iconify-or-deiconify-frame)</tt> (If you have
    bound C-z to something else using `global-set-key', note that
    the new `ignore' binding in `osx-key-mode-map' will shadow
    this. You need to use `define-key' as above.)</li>

    <li>Cursor movement is no longer sluggish when multiple windows
    are visible. Generally, Aquamacs should feel faster. Reported
    by Drew Hess.</li>

    <li>When clicking into an (unselected) window, Aquamacs no
    longer sets the mark and marks a region in the buffer in
    certain circumstances. Reported by Konrad Podczeck.</li>

    <li>Resolved a problem where clicking in the fringe to set a
    breakpoint when using C-mode in conjunction with `gdb' (in the
    Emacs debugger) caused Aquamacs to crash. Reported by Eric
    Martin.</li>

    <li>`gdb' and possibly other packages no longer fail to open
    certain additional `special display' windows. Reported by Eric
    Martin.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs no longer opens additional windows when it opens
    files per drag&amp;drop or as directed by another application
    (such as Finder), if these files are already shown in a buffer.
    Reported by Tim Hsu.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs no longer de-minimizes frames (from the Dock) when
    opening new files while all its frames are hidden. Reported by
    Tim Hsu.</li>

    <li>Documents printed or exported to HTML with soft word
    wrapping turned on will now also exhibit soft wrapping in HTML,
    and wrap as expected at the page boundary on printed pages.
    Reported by Enrico Indiogine.</li>

    <li>OS X will now more reliably recognize the latest installed
    Aquamacs version in order to open documents.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs now remembers more and longer undo steps (maximum
    undo memory and number of steps increased four-fold).</li>

    <li>The ``dialog from hell'', asking users whether they want to
    save a file, or all, or none, or view the file or the
    differences, is now less ridiculous and has a Cancel button.
    Whether the dialog is shown or the minibuffer is used, Aquamacs
    always shows the buffer that is up for saving.</li>

    <li>The command line tool (installed with the Tools menu) will
    now find Aquamacs whereever it is installed in the system. It
    will always use the latest Aquamacs Emacs that is known to the
    system. (As a side-effect, you cannot use the command in
    connection with ``sudo'' any longer. We recommend using Tramp.)
    Reported by Jean-Christophe Helary.</li>

    <li>Bug reporting, and generally, sending e-mail, works now for
    users whose default Email client is Gmail. Gmail receives
    special treatment because of a bug on Google's server.</li>

    <li>Charsets are given in HTML generated with ``Export to
    HTML''. Documents now validate as HTML 4.01 Strict.</li>

    <li>A rare display problem was fixed in cases of vertically
    split windows, with fringes and scroll bars turned off.
    Reported by Rolf Hanson.</li>

    <li>Autoface mode works better with major modes derived from
    other ones.</li>

    <li>More key bindings are now shown correctly in the menus
    (e.g., Undo/Redo).</li>

    <li>Python-mode updated to version 5.1.0. See also:
    <tt><a name="tex2html61" href=
    "https://launchpad.net/python-mode/+announcements" id=
    "tex2html61">https://launchpad.net/python-mode/+announcements</a></tt>.</li>

    <li>Haskell Mode updated to version 2.4. We also provide better
    integration of the mode (recognition of various file types).
    Maintained by Stefan Monnier.</li>

    <li>Prolog Mode 1.18 included with vast improvements (and some
    pre-configuration for Aquamacs). Suggested by Kevin Brubeck
    Unhammer. Code by Stefan Bruda et al.</li>

    <li>ACT-R major mode improved: it inherits `lisp-mode' key
    bindings now. <tt>.actr</tt> files are recognized
    automatically.</li>

    <li>The Enhanced Carbon Emacs plugin is no longer loaded from
    <tt>ec-emacs</tt> directories, because it is incompatible with
    the latest Aquamacs versions.</li>
