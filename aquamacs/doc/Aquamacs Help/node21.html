4 Aquamacs for Emacs Veterans</A>
</H1>

<P>
While experienced users of Emacs on other platforms can continue to use all the key combinations to which they are accustomed, we recommend that they use the Aquamacs-specific conventions to get the most benefit from the applications.  Many of the standard Emacs behaviors and interface conventions have been modified in Aquamacs in the interest of providing a more Aqua-native experience. In this section, we discuss some of the ways that Emacs conventions are mapped to Aqua conventions, and outline some advanced ways that users can modify Aquamacs to their specific preferences.
