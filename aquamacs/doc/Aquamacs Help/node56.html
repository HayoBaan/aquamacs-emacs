  "SECTION0001513000000000000000">14.13 Changes-- 2.0</a></h2>

  <p class="c1">Aquamacs is now based on Emacs 23 and the Cocoa
  NextStep port. There are many changes under the hood associated
  with this, but also a plethora of visible improvements. Major
  ones, and those pertaining to Aquamacs specifically, are listed
  here. Further changes can be found in the NEWS file for Emacs
  23.</p>

  <p class="c2">Major User Interface Improvements</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Spell-checking now uses the system-wide dictionaries in all
    the languages supported on OS X. The standard spelling user
    interface is available as well as the traditional Emacs
    `ispell' interface (which also uses the system-wide spelling
    mechanism). Configure the use of GNU `aspell' through the
    `ispell-program-name' variable if desired.

      <p>Code by Nathaniel Cunningham.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Aquamacs has a new icon in the Dock, designed by graphic
    designer Jessica Walker (jekawacaneer@gmail.com).</li>

    <li>The Aquamacs application has been renamed to
    <i>Aquamacs.app</i> (from Aquamacs Emacs.app).</li>

    <li>Dialogs have been vastly improved: they appear as sheets
    over the frames where they belong, contain better UI elements
    (as in the case of the dialog displayed before quitting
    Aquamacs, which was once called ``dialog from hell'' before
    receiving a makeover). The standard Enter, Space and Esc keys
    (and more) are supported. ``File Save'' panels also appear as
    sheets.</li>

    <li>Toolbars can now be configured through the normal
    customization panel. Right-click on the toolbar, use the
    Options/View menu item (or use M-x ns-tool-bar-customize). The
    chosen icons are persistent; toolbar customizations are,
    however, tied to the toolbars set by modes. That means that
    users can chose a different set of icons to display in
    latex-mode, for instance. The `ns-tool-bar-display-mode'
    variable now supports label-only toolbars. Right-click on the
    toolbar to change; or use M-x customize or
    <tt>Preferences.el</tt> to set it to `labels' in order to only
    show labels. The former meaning of this value (showing labels
    and icons) is now `both' (or, usually, nil, the default).</li>

    <li>Fonts and colors of all (mode-specific) faces can now be
    configured using the standard font and color panels. The
    Options / Appearance menu provides a function to show the font
    panel, which leads to buttons for foreground and background
    colors. We also have a menu item for the color panel
    separately, from where colors can be dragged&amp;dropped
    directly onto any piece of text to customize its face. Holding
    down the Option key will, instead, set the face's background
    color.</li>

    <li>The printing system has been revised; the standard print
    and page setup dialogs are used inside the application. The
    print dialog now appears more quickly. (Note: over-long lines
    will always be wrapped at word boundaries when printing.
    Clipping or horizontal pagination are not supported at this
    time.)</li>

    <li>Line wrapping is now set to Truncate, Wrap, Word Wrap and
    Line Breaking (auto fill) under <i>Options / Line Wrapping</i>
    for the current buffer. A <i>Set as Default</i> will set it as
    default for all buffers that have no explicit line wrap
    setting. As before, there is also a setting to detect word wrap
    in text files. When it is on, Aquamacs detects the wrapping
    style of text-mode buffers automatically, but prefers word
    wrapping (see the customization variable
    `auto-word-wrap-default-function'). <span class="c3">Word
    Wrapping translates to `visual-line-mode' internally now, and
    the former Aquamacs 1.x mode of the same name now corresponds
    to a customization variable called `line-move-visual', which is
    enabled by default. `Longlines-mode' is obsolete. Users with
    manual customizations should adjust their settings. Fine
    control can be achieved by customizing `visual-line-mode',
    `word-wrap', `truncate-lines', and
    `auto-fill-mode'.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="c2">Key Bindings</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It is now possible to customize behavior of right
    Option/Alternate, Command and Control modifiers independently
    of the left ones using new entries in the (renamed) ``Option,
    Command, Meta keys'' menu (in Options) or the new customization
    variables named `ns-right-alternate-modifier' (etc). Patch by
    Marcin Koziej.</li>

    <li>Even when the Option modifier keys are set up to be handled
    by the system (rather than being Meta - see Options - Option
    Key menu), Option-Arrow and Option-Delete key combinations lead
    to wordwise operations (they are recognized as Meta). (Set the
    new `ns-alternate-meta-special-codes' to nil to disable.)</li>

    <li>Note that Word Wrapping (`visual-line-mode') affects the
    function of the cursor movement keys (arrows, and C-a, C-e, C-p
    and C-n). In Aquamacs, this can be easily customized. The
    default is as such:

      <ul>
        <li>In Word Wrapping (visual-line-mode), C-aenp and arrow
        keys move according to visual lines.</li>

        <li>Without Word Wrapping (visual-line-mode off), arrow
        keys move visually, but C-aenp move non-visually according
        to buffer lines as in Emacs 22 and Aquamacs 1.x.</li>
      </ul>Users may configure this behavior via the (new)
      `line-move-visual' customization variable. Set it to <i>t</i>
      for unconditional visual movement of all keys, and <i>nil</i>
      for unconditional logical (buffer) movement of all keys.
    </li>

    <li>Keyboard bindings are displayed more consistently in the
    menus now. Throughout Aquamacs, Mac standard key descriptions
    are used (this may be configured using the variable
    `ns-use-mac-modifier-symbols'). Users should be aware that
    manuals and tutorials will often refer to keys such as
    <tt>C-x</tt> (<tt>X</tt> or Control X), and that keys like
    <tt>M-q</tt> correspond to the chosen Meta key modifier,
    normally the Option key.</li>

    <li>Tabs are now available via the A-1..9 (Command-1..9)
    keybindings. `Split-window-vertically' is now bound to A-M-2
    (Command Option 2), `split-window-horizontally' is A-M-3
    (Command Option 3).</li>

    <li>Command-~&nbsp;now cycles backward to the previously
    selected frame (`raise-previous-frame'). Patch by Matthew
    Dempsky.</li>

    <li>Command-Meta-; now runs `flyspell-buffer', which marks all
    misspellings in the current buffer. Patch by Nathaniel
    Cunningham.</li>

    <li>Command-PageUp/PageDown now jump to the beginning or end of
    the buffer, respectively (`beginning-of-buffer',
    `end-of-buffer').</li>

    <li>When `osx-key-mode' is switched off,
    `x-select-enable-clipboard' is restored to its (new) default
    value, <i>t</i>. That means that kill and yank operations (C-w,
    C-y, mouse text selection and more) are integrated with the Mac
    pasteboard. When `osx-key-mode' is on (as is default),
    everything is as in previous Aquamacs versions: the standard
    copy&amp;paste operations (A-c, A-v) use the system pasteboard,
    while the killring operations from traditional Emacs do not.
    Suggested by Jos&Atilde;&copy; M Figueroa-O'Farrill.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="c2">Editing and Major Modes</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Internally, Emacs is based on a superset of Unicode now.
    Emacs also uses Cocoa, a modern technology that facilitates
    program development and maintenance, supports 64-bit computing
    on Macs and allows for better integration of applications with
    the operating system and other applications.</li>

    <li>Semantic features and Project Support (EDE) are now
    included in Emacs and available from the Tools menu. Note that
    the JDEE plugin distributed with earlier versions of Aquamacs
    is not compatible (and prevents functioning of the new
    functionality. You should remove it (from
    <tt>/Library/Application Support/Aquamacs Emacs/JDEE</tt>) or
    update to a new version of the plugin.</li>

    <li>AUCTeX has ben updated to version 11.86 (was: 11.85). LaTeX
    editing has become more comfortable with this version. For the
    details, please see <span class="c3"><tt><a name="tex2html58"
    href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Changes.html"
      id=
      "tex2html58">http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Changes.html</a></tt></span>.
      The new version improves synchronization with viewer
      programs. Internally, Skim.app integration has changed: Skim
      is always used for all View commands (like C-c C-v) if it is
      already running (customize variable
      `TeX-view-program-selection' to control this).
      `TeX-source-correlate-mode' is on by default in Aquamacs
      (disable by customizing `TeX-mode-hook': remove
      `aquamacs-latex-viewer-support'). To manually change the
      Viewer used for various kinds of files (DVI, PDF, PS), select
      ``LaTeX'' / ``Customize'' and navigate to ``TeX Command'',
      ``TeX View'', ``TeX View Program Selection''. There, choose,
      for instance, Xdvi for the viewer in DVI mode, Skim or
      Preview for PDF mode.

      <p>Patch by Konrad Podczeck and David Reitter.</p>
    </li>

    <li>TeX / LaTeX macros are now found more reliably when using
    TeXLive (`TeX-macro-global' is configured differently).
    Reported by Wolfgang Meiners.</li>

    <li>LaTeX master files in different directories are now found
    reliably when calling `Jump to PDF'. Reported buy Mac
    Pigman.</li>

    <li>Aquamacs uses ``Python-mode'' by default now for Python
    source files. Users who prefer the original Emacs python
    package can switch by including <tt>(require 'python)</tt> in
    their <tt>Preferences.el</tt> file. Code by Barry Warsaw.</li>

    <li>Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) has been updated to version
    5.8 (was: 5.3.10). Refer to the ESS website for changes (
    <span class="c3"><tt><a name="tex2html59" href=
    "http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/readme.html#New-Features" id=
    "tex2html59">http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/readme.html#New-Features</a></tt></span>).</li>

    <li>Ruby mode has been revised to match and track the latest
    version included with GNU Emacs.</li>

    <li>Many more improvements between Emacs 22 and Emacs 23. See
    etc/NEWS at <tt><a name="tex2html60" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.1" id=
    "tex2html60">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.1</a></tt>.
    NB, many of the items listed there do not apply to Mac OS
    X.</li>

    <li>DocView mode is no longer used to display PDF and other
    files (it didn't work well).</li>

    <li><tt>.wiki</tt> files now open in wikipedia-mode.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="c2">Miscellany</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Aquamacs 2.x requires Mac OS X 10.6, or 10.5.8 or later.
    (OS X 10.4 users may compile from source at their own
    risk.)</li>

    <li>When printing, double spaces are formatted as such and can
    be used to align text. Reported by George Nurser.</li>

    <li>HTML and PDF export functions have changed: PDF export can
    be achieved as in any Mac application via the Print dialog. Use
    the new <i>Copy as HTML</i> function in the <i>Edit</i> menu to
    copy formatted text including all the coloring into the
    clipboard in HTML format. Many other applications, including
    presentation software, can then display the formatted text and
    keep it editable.</li>

    <li>Fullscreen mode works largely as before in Mac OS X 10.6;
    in older versions of OS X, it will unconditionally take over
    the full screen (Dock and menu are not visible). <i>Note: there
    are known issues related to scrollbars when returning from
    fullscreen mode. These will be addressed in the next version of
    Aquamacs.</i></li>

    <li>`aquamacs-find-file' (C-x C-f) will ask for confirmation if
    you first complete partial filename input in the minibuffer,
    but then attempt to create a new file.</li>

    <li>Completion is, in many cases, more powerful by completing
    to the left <i>and</i> the right of the input string. Customize
    the option `completion-styles' to control this.</li>

    <li>As per Emacs 23, Aquamacs now supports multi-file commits
    in distributed version-control systems through the VC-dir
    package.</li>

    <li>Users who have included `turn-on-auto-fill' or
    `turn-on-word-wrap' in their customization of `text-mode-hook'
    or other hooks are advised to change this to `set-auto-fill',
    or `set-word-wrap', respectively. These functions are more
    comprehensive and disable (usually) nonsensical
    alternatives.</li>

    <li>A new customization variable `aquamacs-default-major-mode'
    is provided to set the default major mode of newly opened,
    empty buffers. (We recommend keeping `default-major-mode' at
    `fundamental-mode'.)</li>

    <li>The appearance of the echo area (at the bottom of each
    frame) can now be configured via M-x customize-face RET
    echo-area RET. Besides the echo area in general, note the more
    specific faces `minibuffer-prompt' and the new `minibuffer'
    face.</li>

    <li>The Aquamacs Help books (Apple Help) are now displayed more
    reliably when multiple versions of Aquamacs are present on the
    system. The Emacs Lisp Reference as well as the Emacs Manual
    are up to date.</li>

    <li>Auto Save files are now stored in ~/Library/Caches/Aquamacs
    Emacs. This way, they survive reboots such as after system
    crashes (kernel panics, etc.). Reported by Neil Best, Justin
    Pitts and Richard Busby.</li>

    <li>Auto Save files and Session files are purged after 31
    days.</li>

    <li>In some circumstances, point position was changed when
    switching back and forth between tabs directly and also via
    other buffer-switching mechanisms such as opening new
    files.</li>
  </ul>
