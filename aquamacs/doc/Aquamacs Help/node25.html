<P>
AUCTeX comes with its own manual, accessible via the LaTeX menu (when in latex mode after loading a .tex file), ``Read the AUCTeX manual''. If you have a question, please consult the manual. If that doesn't work, or you suspect you've found a bug in AUCTeX, please turn to the AUCTeX mailing lists, accessible here: <TT><A NAME="tex2html16"
  HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/mailing-lists.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/mailing-lists.html</A></TT>.

<P>
To access the enhanced L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X functionality that Aquamacs offers, you will need to install a LaTeX system. We recommend to install the <I>MacTeX distribution</I>, available at <TT><A NAME="tex2html17"
  HREF="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">http://www.tug.org/mactex/</A></TT>. Alternatively, you can install a smaller distribution provided by Gerben Wierda (<TT><A NAME="tex2html18"
  HREF="http://www.rna.nl/tex.html">http://www.rna.nl/tex.html</A></TT>. Both install packages are complete and user-friendly. (While you can obtain T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X from other sources, the binary distributions are particularly well supported in Aquamacs.)

<P>
Note that AUCTeX, as it comes with Aquamacs, is configured to compile documents directly to PDF, a standard on the Mac. If you prefer to produce DVI and Postscript documents with LaTeX, switch off PDF Mode in Command / TeXing Options.

<P>
