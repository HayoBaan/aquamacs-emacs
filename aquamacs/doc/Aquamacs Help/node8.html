3.1 Tabs and Windows</A>
</H2>
Aquamacs has an optional tabbed interface for organizing multiple open buffers. A tab is a GUI handle for a particular buffer. If you have ``Show Tabs'' checked in the Options menu, then each displayed buffer and any buffers that are subsequently created will be associated with a tab in the tab bar, just above the text area. (Note that the tab bar is hidden whenever it would display only a single tab. You may want to turn off ``Show Buffers in New Frames'' in the Options menu, in order to get full benefit from tabs.) If the tab bar cannot display all tabs at once, scroll bars appear to allow you to choose the displayed subset of tabs. Additional tab-related functions are available from the Window menu and from the tab bar's context menu.

<P>
Tabs in Aquamacs do not act like containers -- one can't open a file in an existing tab. (This is in contrast to tab implementation in a number of popular internet browsers.) Rather, tabs provide a convenient way to navigate existing buffers. Because Emacs allows you to simultaneously display the same file in multiple windows or frames, it is possible to have multiple tabs (in different windows) that are associated with the same buffer.

<P>
To access tabs quickly, the key commands A-M-0,1,2 through 9 may be used; A-M-1 (normally: Command-Option-1) will select the first, leftmost tab in the window.<A NAME="tex2html5"

<P>
Note that Tab functionality may be impaired in modes that use the Emacs Header Line.  This includes the Buffer List (C-x C-b) and <I>psvn</I>.

<P>
A related option lets Aquamacs open new buffers in their own, extra frames.  The option may be combined with Tabs, when you want to create tabs manually (Command-T), but visit new files in separate windows.  Normally, we would not recommend to combine the two options. 

<P>
Note that when tabs are switched on, or when buffers are shown in new frames, then closing a window has a different implication: it will remove the buffer from memory (in Emacs terminology, it will <I>kill</I> the buffer).  In case there are unsaved modifications, you will be asked whether you'd like to save them. 
If neither tabs nor ``Show Buffers in New Frames'' is on, then closing a window using Command-W, or closing a whole frame with the red closer button has no such implication.  The buffer remains in memory and is available from the Window menu.  It is not automatically saved.

<P>
