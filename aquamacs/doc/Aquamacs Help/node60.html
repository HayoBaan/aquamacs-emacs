  <ul>
    <li>Aquamacs now handles paragraphs better that are stored as
    single lines in the buffer: these very long ``lines'' are shown
    as paragraphs, with words wrapped were appropriate. The wrap
    functions in the Options menu will use the new technique. As a
    result, line numbers shown in Aquamacs correspond to line
    numbers in the file. Also, word wrap will work better now with
    variable-width fonts. Syntax highlighting is now correct in all
    situations, because it is based on the line separation in the
    underlying file and not on what's displayed (`longlines-mode'
    is not used any longer; a new variable `word-wrap' controls the
    display-time word wrapping.) Code by Kim F. Storm, Chong
    Yidong, David Reitter.</li>

    <li>The end of file lines (newlines) or paragraph endings in
    soft word wrapping can be visualized via Option / Show/Hide /
    Show Newlines (`global-show-newlines-mode').</li>

    <li>Symbols in the fringes have been adapted to look less
    conspicuous. (These are the indicators to the left and right of
    text lines.) Code by Kim F. Storm.</li>

    <li>The ``small left fringe'' setting in the Show/Hide menu
    works again as intended.</li>

    <li>Automatic wrapping detection (hard word wrap = auto-fill,
    vs.&nbsp;soft word wrap) improved. A new customization option
    `auto-word-wrap-default-function' may be used to configure the
    default, which is hard word wrapping.</li>

    <li>Navigation in buffers (up/down) optimized and improved.
    This is also a new buffer-local mode (`visual-line-mode'),
    which is enabled globally (`global-visual-line-mode'). That's
    also what the ``vl'' mode line indicator stands for.</li>

    <li>Command-Backspace will remove the whole visual line now
    (`kill-whole-visual-line'), while Command-Shift-Backspace will
    remove the entire buffer line (which may be a paragraph, when
    soft wrap is on).</li>

    <li>Environment variables are imported again in most situations
    despite bugs in OS X / Emacs. This issue could cause LaTeX
    calls to fail. The *Messages* buffer contains helpful notices.
    Reported by Thomas S. Dye and others.</li>

    <li>An issue where pressing M-Backspace (especially in the
    minibuffer) could lead to an error message has been
    resolved.</li>

    <li>An issue where the Mac (system) input method would
    automatically switch to US or Romaji (in Japanese modes) has
    been resolved.</li>

    <li>An issue where a ``buffer is read-only'' message appeared
    when quitting Aquamacs after some buffer was printed has been
    resolved.</li>

    <li>The frame size, which is retained across sessions, is not
    limited to what is available on the screen: frames cannot be
    bigger any longer.</li>

    <li>A toolbar item to revert the buffer (M-x revert-buffer) is
    now available (configure with Options / Show/Hide / Toolbar
    items)</li>

    <li>isearch, when entered with C-s or C-r, will not cause the
    region to be set to the search match any longer; the region is,
    however, set when isearch is entered with A-f, A-g or A-G. The
    behavior can be controlled with the new customization variable
    `set-region-to-isearch-match'.</li>

    <li>The Help menu (in ``Diagnose and Report Bug'') provides a
    way to start another Aquamacs Emacs instance without any
    personal customizations. This should be used to reproduce any
    potential bugs before reporting them.</li>

    <li>LaTeX configuration (standard paths) simplified.</li>

    <li>Auto Frame Styles are turned on automatically when the user
    chooses to retain frame settings (colors, fonts) for a mode or
    as a default.</li>

    <li>After deleting a tab, the previously selected buffer in a
    window is selected when possible, rather than the rightmost
    tab. This resembles tabs in Firefox rather than tabs in Safari.
    It is more consistent with Emacs and makes life easier for
    users of packages that expect the previous buffer on the stack
    to be selected rather than what's in the tab that happens to be
    at the right edge.</li>

    <li>Tabs and Windows can now be removed without killing the
    buffer shown (Window or tab context menu: Hide Tab, Emacs
    function `tabbar-delete-current-tab').</li>

    <li>Command-W (`close-window') will now delete the selected
    window and, if there is only one window in the frame, the
    frame. When `one-buffer-one-frame-mode' and 'tabbar-mode' are
    off, it will not kill the buffer (or even ask to save it). The
    frame's red ``close'' button will close all windows in the
    frame. This should be convenient for traditional Emacs users.
    <i>Note that C-x k can still be used to just kill a buffer
    without affecting its window.</i></li>

    <li>Clicking the red `close' button will now attempt to kill
    all buffers shown and remove the frame when
    `one-buffer-one-frame-mode' or 'tabbar-mode' are on. Because
    the mouse was used to start the action, dialog boxes are now
    shown in this situation to ask about saving the buffers, rather
    than minibuffer prompts.</li>

    <li>When `one-buffer-one-frame-mode' is off and tabs are on,
    killing the buffer (e.g., with C-x k) will now not remove the
    window and frame any longer (unless Command-W (`close-window')
    is used. Reported by Ian Eure.</li>

    <li>Burying buffers does not always lead to deleting a window
    any longer when `one-buffer-one-frame-mode' is turned on.</li>

    <li>`find-alternate-file' (C-x C-v) now works correctly when
    tabs are used. Reported by Ian Eure.</li>

    <li>Command-Backspace (`kill-whole-visual-line') will not work
    in Comint and related modes that display a read-only prompt at
    the beginning of the line.</li>

    <li>When applied to a region, `unfill' (Edit menu,
    `unfill-paragraph-or-region') will be more flexible in
    recognizing paragraph boundaries. Specifically, paragraphs with
    indented lines will be correctly recognized. Just mark the
    paragraph before pressing M-Q!</li>

    <li>Searching for keywords in the Help menu now includes the
    Emacs Manual and the Emacs Lisp Reference.</li>

    <li>Improvements for Aquamacs calls from the command line:
    files to be opened do not need to exist, and they are now shown
    in the most appropriate window available (or in a new
    one).</li>

    <li>The ``Text properties'' submenu has been remove from the
    Edit menu. (Among the issues: its entries were misleading; text
    properties aren't saved in files.)</li>

    <li>Structure of Help menu revised.</li>

    <li>in SLIME (Lisp mode) and ERC, the Aquamacs tabs work again.
    (`slime-header-line-p' and `erc-header-line-format' now default
    to nil. `erc-mode-line-format' has a new default value.
    Customize these variables to revert to the old behavior.)</li>

    <li>Incompatibility with VM (an optional install) removed.
    Reported by Jos&Atilde;&copy; Figueroa-O'Farrill.</li>

    <li>Internal change: Full-screen editing is now handled via the
    frame parameter `fullscreen'.</li>

    <li>Page-wise scrolling where a single line filled more than a
    screen page has been fixed. Reported by Mac Pigman.</li>

    <li>Command-Shift-S (A-S) now leads to a file selector dialog
    that shows the file name associated with the current buffer, as
    the menu item has done all along. Reported by Nathaniel
    Cunningham.</li>

    <li>Further minor bug fixes.</li>

    <li>Many thanks for your donations since the last version was
    published. Specifically, we would like to thank William Ziemer
    for donating a Mac Mini as our project server.

      <p>If you haven't done so lately, please consider making a
      donation to the project at <tt><a name="tex2html54" href=
      "http://aquamacs.org/donate" id=
      "tex2html54">http://aquamacs.org/donate</a></tt>. Your
      donations are essential in keeping the project going-we have
      no other source of income from Aquamacs. We'd like to do
      great things with Aquamacs, but that'll only happen with your
      support.</p>
    </li>
