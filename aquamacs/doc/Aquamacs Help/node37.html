8 Aquamacs lives from your donations</A>
</H1>

<P>
Aquamacs Emacs is a project that depends on your support. The project
has no other source of substantial income: the application is free,
the downloads are free. 

<P>
Free software is developed because programmers love their work. Donations will never remunerate them financially as a job in the software industry would. But every donation is a recognition of the programmer's hard work, and the bigger ones actually help paying some bills.

<P>
If you would like to say ``thank you'', or if you would like to see
the project developed further, <I>please make a donation.</I>
