14.6 Changes--- 2.5</A>

<LI>Aquamacs is now signed and will now execute with the default GateKeeper settings in OS X 10.8.
</LI>
<LI>Full-screen now supports the standard Mac OS X 10.7 ``Lion'' full-screen mode:  The frame takes up the full (main) display and uses its own screen.  Users may switch between screens as usual (mouse swipe or C-left/right, for instance).  The old-style fullscreen mode is still available, however.  To maximize a frame on the current space, allowing other frames on this space, type C-u A-S-Return, or prepend any of the commands that enter fullscreen mode with C-u.
Thanks for research: Sandy Patterson and Daisuke Murase.
</LI>
<LI>Retina displays are now supported (high-resolution artwork is included in most cases).  LaTeX Preview mode (AUCTeX) has been modified to show high-resolution previews.  (Technical note: other packages can be updated by providing TIFFs with multiple resolutions, or by generating high-DPI images, setting their DPI meta information correctly, and setting the new `ns-true-dpi-images-filename-string' variable while loading images.)
</LI>
<LI>S-tab no longer mapped to C-y (ASCII 25, end of medium). Now properly handled as backtab.  Patch by Gracjan Polak.
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs now provides experimental session persistency:  you can load and save sessions.  Use the new <#932#><EM>Load Session, Save Session As</EM><#932#> menu entries in the <#933#><EM>File</EM><#933#> menu to use these new functions.  Note: Unlike the formerly available functions from the `desktop' package, all frames, windows, tabs, buffers and some customizations are saved.  Buffers not linked to a file, such as those showing processes, will not be restored, and frames may not end up on the same space at this time.  Aquamacs now includes an adapted version of the <#934#><TT>revive.el</TT><#934#> package by Hirose Yuuji.  We recommend that you do not load a different version of this package yourself.
</LI>
<LI>Colors are now displayed in the ``color space'' that is set by the user for the specific display.  A slight change in color shades may be noticed.
Suggested by Juan Jose Garcia Ripoll.
</LI>
<LI>Text search (isearch) now works better when using one of the Emulate-Mac-Keyboard-Modes.
Reported by Thomas Strathmann.
</LI>
<LI>Frames are now reliably moved inside the current display again when entering the minibuffer (and at other times).
</LI>
<LI>Switching applications while Aquamacs is in full-screen mode no longer creates unwanted empty frames.
Reported by Christian H&#246;<#935#><#935#>ltje, Rory Kirchner and Milan Mitrovic<#936#><#936#>.
