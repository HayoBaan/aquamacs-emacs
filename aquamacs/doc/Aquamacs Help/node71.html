<LI>Aquamacs now provides extended input methods for 
	Korean, Japanese and Chinese (GB/BIG5). You can select them in 
	the Options menu, under ;SPMquot;Aquamacs Multilingual Environment;SPMquot; / 
	;SPMquot;Set Language Environment;SPMquot; - everything is integrated with
	Mule.   

<P>
In order to load more fixed-width fonts suitable for use with
	Asian languages, you may want to load the carbon-font package,
	which is included (but not activated) in Aquamacs. Just add the
	following to the file 
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el:

<P>
(require 'carbon-font)

<LI>CSS-Mode fixed. 
	(First reported by Kris Khaira and Michael Jakl.)

<P>

<LI>Dual-head setups (two screens) with one screen on the left, 
	the system menu on the right and Aquamacs frames on the left 
	caused problems.	
	(reported by Otto Karl Florian Diesenbacher)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>osx-key-mode-map can now be changed to modify key
	assignments, in particular those of Apple Command keys
	 (implemented in Emacs as Hyper = H- keys.)
	(reported by William Ziemer)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>;SPMquot;font-lock-keywords ... void;SPMquot; message used to appear when
	attempting to load a new file. This bug in the underlying GNU
	Emacs has been fixed.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple-Q and iconized frames: When all frames where
        iconized and one attempted to quit Aquamacs, the application
        seemed to hang (because it was showing a minibuffer prompt in
        an iconized frame.)
