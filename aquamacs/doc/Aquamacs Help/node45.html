<UL>
<LI>On OS X 10.10 ``Yosemite'', clicks on toolbar icons could cause Aquamacs (as well as GNU Emacs 24.4) to become unresponsive.  Until Apple releases an improved version of the operating system, Aquamacs provides a workaround.
</LI>
<LI>Color dragging out of the color palette (and other drag<tex2html_ampersand_mark>drop actions) right after startup now works reliably.
</LI>
<LI>Color dragging to set colors of the fringes in a window works again.
</LI>
<LI>The size of LaTeX previews on Retina displays has been corrected.  For convenience, Aquamacs will no longer ask whether to ``cache the preamble'' (who knows what that entails anyway?).
</LI>
<LI>AUCTeX has been updated to version 11.88 (from version 11.87). See here for what's new: <TT><A NAME="tex2html33"
