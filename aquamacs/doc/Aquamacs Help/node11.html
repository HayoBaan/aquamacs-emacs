3.4 Edit</A>
</H2>
The Edit menu is the heart of Aquamacs' textual wizardry. Aquamacs supports
all customary editing functions, such as cut, copy, paste, and simple
search and replace. In Aquamacs these basic functions are supported by
standard Aqua keyboard shortcuts. There is a great deal more
functionality, however, than the average text editor. For instance,
Aquamacs Emacs allows you to go to a specific line number in the file you are
editing, to the top or bottom of the buffer, and so on. It also supports searches with <I>regular 
expressions,</I>
which are sophisticated text patterns that go beyond simply matching a
specific set of characters (or ``string''). Aquamacs Emacs also stores more
than twenty of the most recently-copied items on the clipboard, and
these are accessible from the menu in case you need to paste these
items again.  The Edit menu also supports ``bookmarks,'' a feature
that allows you to save your place in a specific file.

Aquamacs lets you spell-check your texts, either while typing (`flyspell-mode') or for the whole buffer with an interactive interface (`ispell').
