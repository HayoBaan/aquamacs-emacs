3.5.3 Languages of the World - Dealing with Different Character Sets</A>
</H3>

<P>
Computer keyboards were designed to input text in languages with a
small character set.  Aquamacs Emacs lets you use your keyboard with a
variety of <I> input methods </I> in order to input text in languages
with many characters, among them Asian languages.

<P>
By default, Aquamacs uses the standard Mac user interface to input
characters, called ``System Input Method''.

<P>
The Multilingual Environment, present in GNU Emacs, provides a number
of predefined input methods.  Aquamacs Emacs extends this: On Mac OS
X, because of the particular ways of user interface and unicode
handling, these standard Emacs language environments are not enough to
read and write some international languages.  One needs to set
additional parameters, especially, the language specific coding
systems.

<P>
You can find these new language environments (Korean, Japanese,
Chinese-GB and Chinese-BIG5) -- among other ones -- under ;SPMquot;Aquamacs
Multilingual Environment;SPMquot;.
