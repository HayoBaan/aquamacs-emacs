6.5 Changing Aquamacs source files</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you'd like to tinker with the Emacs lisp source files that come with Aquamacs, you can do so quite easily. When activaten a new function or evaluate an expression, C-x C-e is your friend.

<P>
However, you may notice that some of your changes aren't active after you've saved your work (into the Aquamacs application bundle) and restart. That is because some of the code is precompiled into the Aquamacs binary and not loaded from the source (or .elc / .el.gz) files. To alleviate that problem, create a
file
<BR><#241#><TT>/Library/Application~Support/Aquamacs~Emacs/site-prestart.el</TT><#241#> 
<BR>with the following content:

<P>
<TT>(setq aquamacs-reload-preloaded-files t)</TT>

<P>
This will cause to re-read the otherwise preloaded files from disk.

<P>
