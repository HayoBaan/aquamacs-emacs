<h3 class="section">16.3 Documentation Strings and Compilation</h3>

<p><a name="index-dynamic-loading-of-documentation-1051"></a>
  When Emacs loads functions and variables from a byte-compiled file,
it normally does not load their documentation strings into memory. 
Each documentation string is dynamically loaded from the
byte-compiled file only when needed.  This saves memory, and speeds up
loading by skipping the processing of the documentation strings.

   <p>This feature has a drawback: if you delete, move, or alter the
compiled file (such as by compiling a new version), Emacs may no
longer be able to access the documentation string of previously-loaded
functions or variables.  Such a problem normally only occurs if you
build Emacs yourself, and happen to edit and/or recompile the Lisp
source files.  To solve it, just reload each file after recompilation.

   <p>Dynamic loading of documentation strings from byte-compiled files is
determined, at compile time, for each byte-compiled file.  It can be
disabled via the option <code>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</b><var><a name="index-byte_002dcompile_002ddynamic_002ddocstrings-1052"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this is non-<code>nil</code>, the byte compiler generates compiled files
that are set up for dynamic loading of documentation strings.

        <p>To disable the dynamic loading feature for a specific file, set this
option to <code>nil</code> in its header line (see <a href="../emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">Local Variables in Files</a>), like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -*-byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings: nil;-*-
</pre>
        <p>This is useful mainly if you expect to change the file, and you want
Emacs sessions that have already loaded it to keep working when the
file changes. 
</p></blockquote></div>

accomplished by writing compiled files with a special Lisp reader
construct, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#@</span><var>count</var></samp>&rsquo;.  This construct skips the next
<var>count</var> characters.  It also uses the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#$</span></samp>&rsquo; construct, which
stands for the name of this file, as a string.  Do not use these
constructs in Lisp source files; they are not designed to be clear to
humans reading the file.
