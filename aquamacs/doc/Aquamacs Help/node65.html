<LI>Frames (windows) now have a little icon in the title bar for the
	selected buffer, and you can drag<tex2html_ampersand_mark>drop this to other applications.
	Patch by  Mitsuharu Yamamoto

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Clicking the Dock icon of Aquamacs will now bring up a minimized
	frame, if there is no other frame to be shown - just like in any
	OS X application.
	Suggested by Frank Atanassow

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fonts can now be selected comfortably with the OS X standard
	font selector, accessible via ;SPMquot;Options - Show Fonts;SPMquot;.
	Remember  - to make a setting stick, use the ;SPMquot;Frame Appearance
	Styles;SPMquot;. Set the new style either for the given major mode, or as
	a default.
	Patch by  Mitsuharu Yamamoto

<LI>C-n and C-p are now mapped to `next-line' / `previous-line'
	again, so they may be used to jump full lines (as defined by
	carriage returns) - even if the lines are wrapped around. The
	arrow keys move the cursor visually as before. 
	Suggested by Tom van Vleck

<P>

<LI>Apple-` now cycles through all the frames, not just the topmost two.
	Reported by William Henney

<LI>Apple-: now spell-checks the buffer, provided ispell is installed.
	Suggested by Jean-Christophe Helary

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple-Shift-S will now bring up a file selector rather than
	prompting for a file name in the minibuffer. If you prefer the
	Emacs-style prompt, you should use the Emacs-style key binding:
	C-x C-w.
	Suggested by Jean-Christophe Helary

<P>

<LI>Emulate-Mac-Keyboard-Mode: improved support for French keyboard
	layouts

<P>

<LI>ESS 5.3.0 included

<P>
</LI>
<LI>SLIME - the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode is now available with
	Aquamacs. It's pre-configured for you. Use `lisp-mode' for your
	Lisp editing, and run M-x slime to start a lisp inferior
	process. You may need to set the variable `inferior-lisp-program'
	via customization or in your Preferences.el as follows:

<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim32#</PRE>

<LI>C++ Mode is used automatically for .cp files.

<P>

<LI>Keyboard bug-fix: certain keys could not be successfully input
	on certain keyboard layouts, most notably the key combination 
	C-c ` as used in LaTeX mode (AUCTeX) was not available on German
	keyboards.
	Patch by Taiichi Hashimoto

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Ispell/LaTeX bug-fix: ispell will now ignore TeX commands in
	such buffers.
